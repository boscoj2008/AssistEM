[dawn of the planet of the apes] is a text book example of how to stay true to the basic genetic code of a movie while also letting it evolve into a different, altogether more sophisticated beast. dawn of the planet of the apes works precisely because it believes in itself and will brook no arguments.  \nASSISTANT:",

[a] kitsch-fu confection, with its overblown sentimentalism matched only by its tacky day-glo backgrounds... the action choreography, however, is imaginative and excellent. with an incomprehensible plot and boring fight scenes there's not much to recommend when it comes to the white haired witch of lunar kingdom.  \nASSISTANT:",

[a] kitsch-fu confection, with its overblown sentimentalism matched only by its tacky day-glo backgrounds... the action choreography, however, is imaginative and excellent. with an incomprehensible plot and boring fight scenes there's not much to recommend when it comes to the white haired witch of lunar kingdom.  \nASSISTANT:",
