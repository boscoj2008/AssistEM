Violent and noirish Batman is engaging but cynical. Neither terrific nor terrible, Son of Batman bears some similarities to a Saturday morning Batman cartoon; it's fast-paced, action-packed, entirely disposable and extremely fun at times. Serving more as a decent introduction to a new character to the Batman mythos than a fully developed adaptation of the Grant Morrison storyline, 'Son of Batman' is entertaining, but hardly essential viewing for DC animated movie fans. Son of Batman is not Batman and Son. It's a pig wrapped in a silk cape and cowl.  ",

Ultimately, it didn't move me in any way. A lot of thought and effort has been put into City of Ember but the whole is never more than the sum of its parts. It wants to be an adventure story and a fable and a mystery all at the same time and never quite decides what it is. One of the best family films of the year...if you like your kid movies with a little more bruising than normal. Built upon a bedrock of dazzling and richly constructed sets -- think Dr. Seuss meets Jules Verne meets Mad Max -- and complemented by rock-solid storytelling, it's an enormously enjoyable family film.

Harlin's film begins with the familiar adage that truth is the first casualty of war. Usually that phrase precedes an attempt to revive the patient, not bury it deeper in the rubble of propaganda.

Flimsy dramatization of Russia/Georgia conflict fails both as historical re-enactment and as action-flick thrill ride.

Keeping track of everyone is difficult and the screenplay is laughably bad in spots, making it even less palatable. The performances are stiff and uninspired, the storyline is trite, the awkward special effects stand out like a sore thumb, and everything is just so elongated that a couple of decent action scenes won't save an hour and a half of complete boredom. With lame action, dull storytelling and a cast that look like they simply don't care, it's sub-par style over non-existent substance as The White Haired Witch of Lunar Kingdom laboriously plods through its 104 minute running-time. [a] kitsch-fu confection, with its overblown sentimentalism matched only by its tacky day-glo backgrounds... The action choreography, however, is imaginative and excellent. With an incomprehensible plot and boring fight scenes there's not much to recommend when it comes to The White Haired Witch of Lunar Kingdom.  ",

It winks at itself constantly, but only to hide its cluelessness. The whole film feels fairly self indulgent on Seth Rogen's part. It's rather dull and quite a letdown.

Gyllenhaal might have seemed like an odd choice to top-line an action flick, given his indie leanings and wet noodle persona, but he's surprisingly tolerable as Dastan; a parkour-obsessed oik who grows into an abs-solutely un-flabulous warrior. Someday someone is going to make a great film from a video game. Until then we have to be satisfied with being decently entertained without being hopelessly insulted. Prince of Persia manages to avoid doing either, so the wait continues. This movie stars exactly one paleface American and several paler-faced Brits in almost all the supporting roles.

An appealing portrait miniature of a woman who loses and finds her bearings ... The film is so uneven, the characters and relationships so undeveloped, it's hard to work up much sympathy. As she flails through a few dubious choices, the character may be on the kind of self-discovery path we've seen in countless other films; but Winstead makes the outcome seem far from preordained.

While the original Mitty was a heartbreakingly sad figure, this Mitty is a weak parable for living life to the fullest (or something like that.) The Secret Life of Walter Mitty provides fun and laughs, but also meaningful thoughts on life and how we choose to live it, along with a touching lead performance you'll want to root for. Steve Conrad's script is a jumbled farce, misfiring on comedic executions and inserting beats that have no real relevance to the story. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is one charming film to see, and there's nothing wrong with a feel-good movie that makes you feel good about liking it.  ",

Barratier can't seem to do anything with it other than keep raising the violence and anger. The two threads aren't really woven together into the sort of tight, overarching theme that the film seems built to convey. Though it's handled with little subtlety, the way the atmosphere of suspicion in Vichy France filters down to the kids is a smart slant on the material.

The somber period western \"Echoes of War\" retraces some well-traveled moral ground but is invigorated by a cast that includes James Badge Dale, Ethan Embry and William Forsythe. A gloomy, somewhat underwritten story of two families just after the Civil War, an exploration of the kind of disruption that lingers after fighting on the battlefield is over. There's something stale about Kane Senes's tepid historical drama Echoes of War, which utilizes the genre's symbols without delivering on its potential for moral or narrative satisfaction. This tale of the futility of revenge works well enough on its own modest terms.  ",

The actual dancing scenes are occasionally electrifying, if far too sparse, but other than that and the welcome sight of co-star Chris Brown getting clocked in the face, the film barely gets off the ground, much less sticks the landing. A dead-in-the-soul cash grab of a movie set in the competitive world of B-boy dancing that thinks clich\u0329s, phony melodrama and product placement can substitute for real storytelling and actual characters. Battle of the Year clearly features lots of brilliant dancers, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy watching them move. But you wish there were more dancing here.

It doesn't help that the songs, while solid, become repetitive in melody. And there's not a home run in the bunch. I walked out humming ... nothing from this movie. Richard LaGravenese's adaptation of Jason Robert Brown's The Last Five Years presents an intriguing and compelling spin on the standard musical, and on storytelling in general. It's a film to bring tears to the eyes of a cynic - in fact, a cynic might relish it more than anyone, since it's the counterpointing of exuberance with unashamed bleakness that makes The Last Five Years so rich. A musical lives or dies based on the quality of its songs, and though The Last Five Years delivers some solid tunes none of them are earworms that'll stay with you beyond the closing credits.  ",

If you're gonna make me smell dung for two hours, at least fertilize my lawn. There's no denying Franco's ambition, and in \"Child of God\" you can see evidence (almost for the first time) that he's reaching for something he may one day attain. \"Child of God\" fascinates like a song sung just out of tune but rhythmically sturdy enough to keep you listening in the hopes it'll right itself. Surprisingly pretty good. This wrong-headed adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's taut 1973 novel, as interpreted by director James Franco, spends too much time trying to create an element of compassion for this devilishly aberrant killer.

This simple yet shiver-inducing tale, the auspicious feature debut of Australian writer/director Jennifer Kent, makes for one of the better horror movies of recent times. It presents grief as a demon, questions reality, and creeps out the viewer by making psychopathology seem like something that could happen to anybody. At its heart, \"The Babadook\" is a story of mother and son, whose relationship ultimately determines whether they survive the demon - or die trying. In the running with Boyhood as my favorite movie of 2014 is another work that turns on the challenges of parenting. This one is a tad more insane.  ",

The film has enough charm and humor to keep it appealing to a wide audience, and dumbing things down doesn't feel particularly smart or canny, and proves to be a minor distraction to an otherwise majorly entertaining feature. Far from the shameless emotional pummeling it might have been, this adaptation of John Green's cherished YA cancer drama finds a conduit to earned, understated tears -- a tricky accomplishment given the material. \"The Fault in Our Stars\" may not show the true messiness of cancer, but it does grapple with death and the ability to survive great loss. Maybe that's enough truth for one movie. Although certain plot points skirt dangerously close to clich\u0329s that more cynical viewers will have been dreading, somehow they manage to resolve plausibly.  ",

Skarsgard is riveting throughout as a man whose high morality is steeped in hypocrisy and whose mask of civility easily slips, when challenged, to reveal the monster beneath.

Wong Kar-Wai doesn't supply much of a plot with a narrative engine to pull us through. I struggled to engage with the archetypes contained within the images, even with all that meticulously restored golden-yellow sand. Wong Kar Wai seems considerably more out of his depth than other Chinese filmmakers who have slummed in the martial arts genre.

It celebrates female friendship in a way few movies do, but good intentions don't always make for a good film. the concept was rife with possibilities that could synergize with Graynor's fresh appeal as well as her rising-star status.

Low Down is like the version of Billy Strayhorn's Lush Life played in one of this film's club scenes: somber, moody and cool to the touch. The acting makes it a far more compelling ride than it otherwise would have been.  ",

Ultimately nothing more than a decrepit vehicle for the moldiest of scary-movie clich\u0329s: screechy specters, inane character behavior and jump scares that a toddler could anticipate minutes ahead of time. Some decent scares are provided in this refreshingly low-key ghost story. This sequel in name only is a superior pic in almost every possible way, and deserves better than the half-hearted dump -- limited theatrical exposure day-and-date with VOD release -- it's been given by Lionsgate.

Its holes or omissions cannot diminish the gaping eloquence of the situation and the questions that arise.

There's a fair amount of greening, but that doesn't make Whitney any less grating. As she learns the value of public schools and pickup trucks, her erstwhile friends in Philadelphia seem happy to be rid of her. By movie's end, you'll feel exactly the same. It flies off the rails in a third act so devoid of logic it could have been concocted on the moon. Helmer Odiorne creates a suitably groomed pastoral setting for Gilchriest's relentlessly upbeat script, but does little to suggest a context larger than Whitney's limited p.o.v.  ",

Rather than the That's Entertainment of jumps, falls and back flips, actor-director Robin Shou's tribute to his former profession is half-baked and a little self-serving. It jumps from one subject to another, it provides little historical context, it shows a lot of stunts being prepared and executed but refuses to ask the obvious questions in our minds. Feels more like a 'making-of' piece or vanity project for actor and first-time director Robin Shou ... than a tight, thorough documentary.
