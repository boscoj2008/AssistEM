Harris, a talented comic actress who looks more like a real person than a Hollywood facsimile of one, makes every scene she's in shine. \"Gayby\" is too diffuse to have much pop when it comes to the topics at hand: love and friendship, and how unconventional modern permutations might help rewrite the script of romance.

Personally, I wearied of Tarantino's breathless shtick long ago, but I must admit I enjoyed Inglourious Basterds more than anything he's done in years.

Prisoners is in the best thriller traditions, but goes deeper into a reflection of one of the greatest moral dilemmas in modern society ... choosing to not only be memorable, but to matter.

Overlong, overcooked, overextended and over-everythinged but never amusing. Pixels' predecessors, such as Ghostbusters, had an irreverent disrespect for authority and a deadpan outlook, but few of the many elements here are developed beyond the rudimentary.  ",

As the three friends separate via commercial successes afforded them, \"Lords Of Dogtown\" becomes a distinctly youthful American anecdote about the nature of friendship and success. You don't have to care much about skateboarding (I really don't) to find the movie exhilarating and engaging. Dogtown's testosterone fueled, deeply and sadly affectionate excursion into the contact highs and lows of male adolescence, gets it just right and more. A modestly entertaining movie, thanks largely to the efforts of director Catherine Hardwicke and the three leads.  ",

While these orgies of violence are staged with tense, gruesome precision, they don't convey much beyond what we already know. Namely, that war is hell. Message received. Pitt, who at 50 still looks great with his shirt off, has the gruff charisma to play a dauntless soldier with killer courage and a vestigial streak of humanity. It's an \"unflinching\" account of war -- \"unflinching,\" in quotes, because every moment of the film is composed to grind your face into the muck and be proud of itself for doing so. Pitt is at the top of his game, playing a man who has forgotten whatever he used to be and has wholly embraced his role in this war.  ",

By the thrilling... Nolan satiates his taste for the big action set piece, but all is grounded in an intricately woven world of fierce loyalty and even more fierce enmity. You should consider the overall brilliance of Nolan's series of \"Dark Knight\" films and wonder whether the next filmmaker willing to take on the caped crusader's story is batty. Lacking a central figure as dazzling as Heath Ledger's Joker, The Dark Knight Rises is not as strong as its predecessor, but it's still a doozy. Um, a violent, grim, nightmarish doozy.

Like a less successful version of The Notebook, this works as an undemanding date movie; just don't expect much more from it. Ultimately the vision of love and marriage that is being presented here is a fairly routine, secular one, that it is love that binds us to a vow and not the other way around. \"The Vow\" might have been a decent film had the filmmakers taken the time to allow the characters to develop, or perhaps even if a better actor was cast in the lead. Thankfully The Vow spares us from all of that shakey-camera'd nonsense, but that's about all it spares us from.  ",

But it's not all that difficult to succumb to its full-spirited romanticism either.

The Last Samurai is an idyll in which the savageries of existence are transcended by spiritual devotion. That's a beautiful dream, and it gives the film a deep pleasingness, but the fullness of life and its blackest ambiguities are sacrificed. does honor traditional Japanese culture and ideals and make them accessible to a wider audience Outstanding action and performance; lots of blood.

Although it drags at times and is simply too long, dampening the emotional impact of some key plot points, the fine performances -- particularly Garfield's and a fine closing scene -- will leave you thinking this Spider-Man is still kind of amazing.

It feels like a typical action movie that's been sawed off and sanded down - its blunt edges sharpened, its soft center drained out. It's not particularly original, but it is mean, relentless, and bracing. A fable about New Zealand's indigenous Maori people before the arrival of European settlers, \"The Dead Lands\" values entertainment over archaeology. Action fans will enjoy the fight scenes while the rest of us may find the film perversely interesting from a socio-anthropological perspective.

To quote his favorite author: No profit grows where is no pleasure taken. Thor is on much safer ground here on Earth. The tone is immediately different: more relaxed; comic, not cosmic. Thor is a really good popcorn flick -- just a little too bloated in places to hit the mark as well as it could have. The mildly amusing midsection plays like a Viking take on Crocodile Dundee. Strikes a mighty blow to the summer blockbuster season and will charge up audiences just like the first 'Iron Man.'  ",

Clooney's lugubrious direction mimics the worst of those star-studded early-1960s epics, with lots of long dissolves and chunky inertia. I respect the inspiring story being told, but the film's screenplay doesn't have the necessary weight in its pages, or the depth in its characters. The Monuments Men scatters its cast all across Western Europe as they hunt down the world's treasures, but fails to provide them with narrative thrust to move things along.

Summary discovered on a rare map. Correctly assuming his cast and crew would be wary of such a journey Denham has told them they're traveling to Singapore but before they set sail his leading lady drops out of the project. Needing a beautiful actress willing to take a risk Denham finds Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) a beautiful but down-on-her-luck vaudeville performer and offers her the role; cautious but eager to work Darrow takes the role and onboard the ship she strikes up a romance with Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) a respected playwright hired by Denham to write the script for his latest epic.When Denham and company arrive on Skull Island the natives react with savage violence but they happen to be the least of their worries. Skull Island is a sanctuary for prehistoric life and lording it over the dinosaurs and other giant beasts is Kong a 25-foot-tall gorilla who can outfight any creature on Earth. The natives kidnap Darrow giving her to Kong as an offering to appease the giant beast; Denham and his men set out to find her with Driscoll bravely determined to save the woman he loves. Eventually Driscoll finds Darrow and Denham outwits Kong intending to take the giant ape back to New York for display. But Kong has bonded with Darrow and his attraction to her proves to be his undoing. Andy Serkis who provided the body movements for Gollum in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings pictures performed similar duties on King Kong studying gorillas so he could mimic their actions which were then used as the basis for the special-effects crew's digital animation of the great ape. ~ Mark Deming Rovi ratings Rating 7.7 ContentRating PG-13  ",

Although it drags at times and is simply too long, dampening the emotional impact of some key plot points, the fine performances -- particularly Garfield's and a fine closing scene -- will leave you thinking this Spider-Man is still kind of amazing. Everyone has done an excellent job on director Marc Webb's exciting, well-crafted sequel to his first Spider-Man film. But it's impossible to reboot audiences' brains, and forget the same job was done even better, only the other day. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 certainly has its moments, but for the most part it's just middle-of-the-pack blockbuster fare. Frustrates as much as it entertains.  ",

The Return Of The King ultimately proves up to the series' increasingly difficult task: making movies that echo legends, making legends that reflect life, and reconciling it all with the fact that both legends and lives all eventually meet their ends. Yes, the running time is long, and yes, those many endings in a slow, dreamy coda left me feeling spent -- better spent than I can ever remember. This is the crowning glory -- a cinematic feat that satisfies at every level. Satisfyingly, Astin's Sam grows the most here, coming into his heroic own. His big eyes, gazing adoringly and beseechingly at the tormented Frodo, speak volumes about loyalty and bravery.  ",

Lively's cool, timeless poise is perfect for Adaline's melancholy reserve, the aloofness of someone from a different era, wary of letting anyone get too close. The Age of Adaline is salvaged by the performances of Lively and Ford; that is if you're brain hasn't been shutdown by fake science. Fans of more curious romantic dramas such as Benjamin Button and The Time Traveller's Wife will get the most out of The Age of Adaline, an engrossing if flawed drama. Staying 29 forever is every woman's fantasy. But, as \"Gossip Girl\" alum Blake Lively finds out in the predictable but endearing love story \"The Age of Adaline,\" that blessing becomes a burden.

It's also a cathartic, occasionally clunky nostalgiafest. Come the conclusion, tears no doubt will be shed, probably by those more devoted than I. Whether they cry because of overwhelming emotion or in mourning an era's end, I'm not sure. Probably both. Radcliffe retains an endearingly owlish demeanor. But he also captures the quiet determination of a young man determined to confront his life-or-death destiny -- making the world safe for good folks, wizards and Muggles alike -- with admirable aplomb. It's a bittersweet end as the final adaptation of the beloved books hits the big screen. Expect tears, both from nostalgia and some truly amazing storytelling.  ",

A sick joke of a film that realizes the best children's entertainment doesn't hide from the bleaker side of life, but plunges into the void and respects kids enough to assume they can handle it.

The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is another grand entry in the Tolkien saga, raising the emotional and physical stakes while revealing more of the sinister forces that we know will ultimately come to threaten the entire world. (There) seems to be more action this time around. It's much more thrilling and is, again, pertinent, necessary action. And the character moments just work better in this installment. Smaug slept through the first Hobbit film, and boy was I jealous. For all the great effects it garners, [it] is a cold, and monotonous epic that borders on fan fiction.  ",

A highly-watchable but stilted sequel that serves as a complacent sequel to the fun original. Much of the originality has faded and Morgan Freeman's absence is keenly felt, but the end result is still a fun, exciting adventure. Red 2 fails to capture the fun of the first film, but manages to hold on to its weaker traits, such as a bloated runtime and an inundation of mindless action sequences, turning this into a rather forgettable affair. The cookie-cutter action sequences - car chases, fireballs, shoot-outs - are so-so and whereas the first film had a giddy cheekiness to it, the vibe here just feels forced, a common trait of sequels we really weren't hankering for.

Violent and noirish Batman is engaging but cynical. Neither terrific nor terrible, Son of Batman bears some similarities to a Saturday morning Batman cartoon; it's fast-paced, action-packed, entirely disposable and extremely fun at times. Serving more as a decent introduction to a new character to the Batman mythos than a fully developed adaptation of the Grant Morrison storyline, 'Son of Batman' is entertaining, but hardly essential viewing for DC animated movie fans. Son of Batman is not Batman and Son. It's a pig wrapped in a silk cape and cowl.  ",

Summary his wife and son in hopes of recapturing the glory of his youth. Unfortunately for Alby Elias is all grown up now and isn't exactly overjoyed to see the \"best friend\" whose rosy vision of childhood largely came from the fact that he made Elias the unwitting butt of his every joke. When Alby learns that Elias is taking a group of disabled drama students on a trip to the local amusement park Elias has no choice but to let his pushy pal come along for the ride. What follows is a pensively hilarious look life as seen through the eyes of a man who can't seem to move past his youth and the effect that a student-clown bartender (Amy Sedaris) a disgruntled former amusement park employee (Alan Cumming) a retired water-park mermaid (Debbie Harry) and a whole host of colorful characters have in helping Alby to bridge the gap between the glory days of his past and an uncertain future. ratings Rating 5.3 ContentRating Unrated  ",

Really great performances... but this inspired-by-fact tale... only just skims the many provocative issues it touches on, and is rather anticlimactic in the end. A plea-filled, soapish human-interest story that's too sudsy, Black or White can't lather over its basic message-movie-ness, but its moral's hardly Shakespearean in its profundity: \"What fools these adults be, bickering over a sweet little girl.\"  ",

Here, the feelings run very deep, and dark as dried blood, with Clint aware that some things don't need to be said and others shouldn't be shown. Possibly the richest testament Hollywood has yet made about the paroxysm of World War II ... an astounding movie on every level, not the least of which is its common humanity. Sequences fade into the pack and make it difficult to differentiate one player from the others, much less remember them after the lights go up. A human-sized contemplation of propaganda and fame  ",

A gloomy, somewhat underwritten story of two families just after the Civil War, an exploration of the kind of disruption that lingers after fighting on the battlefield is over. There's something stale about Kane Senes's tepid historical drama Echoes of War, which utilizes the genre's symbols without delivering on its potential for moral or narrative satisfaction.

Never once does the film feel sharp on black identity (as did Bill Gunn's original), and the terror is theoretical only.

Da Sweet Blood of Jesus is a mess, but it's the kind of mess only one of our greatest filmmakers could make.

A sumptuous unravelling of secrets wrapped in tantalizing stories that gradually interconnect the lives of an ensemble of characters who seduce, betray and defend each other in the years surrounding the Peninsular War. Based on the sprawling 19th-century novel by Camilo Castelo Branco, Chilean director Raul Ruiz renders an equally sprawling tale filled with love and war, violence and vengeance and the search for identity. This isn't one of those epics that uses length as a bludgeon. Rather than sweep, the movie spirals, twisting its viewpoint to reveal tales within tales. A sprawling 19th century novel filtered through the mind of a trickster filmmaker, the late Ra\u033cl Ruiz, who both delights in and subverts his wildly complex and melodramatic source material.  ",

Director Kevin Macdonald successfully ties the psychological tension with the physical, using the tight confines of a submarine setting rather masterfully, squeezing each drop of tension and expertly pacing every plot twist in Dennis Kelly's screenplay. With stunning underwater visuals, and a story that is engaging enough despite its obvious turns, there may be gold here yet. The plot doesn't entirely hold water... but Law exudes brawny charisma and helps the film build up a good head of sweaty, claustrophobic tension. Black Sea is another strongly made drama from British filmmaker Kevin Macdonald and, like The Last King of Scotland and State of Play, is about a protagonist in an untenable situation.  ",

Performances are more mature, the soundtrack (by Nicholas Hooper) less grandiose, and Yates executes some thrilling set-pieces.

Bring your Dramamine! It may indeed be inspired by a true story, but what we see onscreen is simply \"Star Wars\" set in some fantasy French air base circa 1917. The characters, although based on real life people, are one-dimensional stereotypes that exist for the sole purpose of presenting indistinguishable flesh-and-blood pilots for superabundant air battles. The best of Pearl Harbor meeting the worst of HBO's Band of Brothers. Yearning for a time when warfare seemed so much simpler and more honourable, Flyboys is a thrilling, spectacular ride - but only when its dull characters get off the ground.  ",

There's voyeurism, fetishism, bondage, lingerie and high-flown naughtiness galore, but that's hardly the movie's most conspicuous achievement. The Duke of Burgundy is no mere style exercise or slavish homage. Strickland finds both humour and pathos in the situation of Cynthia and Evelyn, who are every bit as trapped as the insects they collect and catalogue. The Duke of Burgundy is like Fifty Shades of Grey as staged by Masterpiece Theater. It will appeal to a limited group of high cinephiles, and those who always got off on the kind of fantasy soft-porn the film so dutifully replicates, and most of all, to the subset of folk who are both. That would be me.  ",

A prologue featuring French poet Rimbaud underlines Mishory's vision of the American actor as part of a line of iconoclastic artists. But his pre-fame Dean seems more sullen brat than talented maverick. Mishory's film walks the same forlorn street as that of Bruce Weber's 1988 Chet Baker documentary, Let's Get Lost, and shares its palpable fascination for an iconic individual cursed by both beauty and artistic genius. Matthew Mishory's A Portrait of James Dean: Joshua Tree, 1951, some will argue, is a triumph of style over substance. Its beauty is marred whenever it opens its mouth.  ",

Yes. Is it indulgent? Absolutely. At two hours 24 minutes the final Hobbit movie is the shortest of all of Peter Jackson's Middle-earth epics but it still feels like butter scraped over too much bread. Such ingenuity is at the service of a project that lost its emotional core when Jackson decided to take Tolkien's relatively streamlined novel and pump it up into three plus-sized movies. At two hours and 24 minutes it's the shortest of the trilogy, but it still feels longer than it needs to be. Often spectacular and increasingly involving, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies delivers a good payoff for a trilogy marred with issues of self-indulgence.  ",

As a story, it evokes a word that no battlefield nurse would ever apply to her experiences: sterile. Testament of Youth isn't a typical biopic; it's a heartfelt manual on forging ahead. Beneath all that genre eye candy, though, resides a smart and moving story that, after a somewhat slow-moving first hour, builds nicely to become an emotionally engaging drama.  ",

The Duke of Burgundy is no mere style exercise or slavish homage. Strickland finds both humour and pathos in the situation of Cynthia and Evelyn, who are every bit as trapped as the insects they collect and catalogue. The Duke of Burgundy is like Fifty Shades of Grey as staged by Masterpiece Theater. It will appeal to a limited group of high cinephiles, and those who always got off on the kind of fantasy soft-porn the film so dutifully replicates, and most of all, to the subset of folk who are both.

Skarsgard is riveting throughout as a man whose high morality is steeped in hypocrisy and whose mask of civility easily slips, when challenged, to reveal the monster beneath.

I've lost my sweet tooth for slice-and-dice escapism, and perhaps this is why I feel the need to see movies that don't simply glamorize or fetishize or supernaturalize brutality. The pop encyclopedist and video-store genius has become a megalomaniac, and the exhilarating filmmaker he might have been is disappearing fast. It has its moments, and Thurman is an appealing heroine. But on the whole, this is a disjointed, disappointing and monstrously self-indulgent exercise.  ",

[Director] Sommers did the first two chaotic Mummy remakes; those play like Tender Mercies compared to this one. A dull, passionless take on a property that any fan could have outdone with half the budget. No Joe! It's about nothing, but who cares? It's the last big action movie of the summer and it does what it's supposed to do. Here comes GI Joe, a film so loud and dumb it makes Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen look like a Mike Leigh docudrama.  ",

Gone Girl is easily one of the best thrillers to come out of Hollywood in years. The most loathsome movie I've seen in the twenty-eight years I've been reviewing films.

Aquamarine's father is a leader of the undersea world who has arranged for his daughter to marry a boy whom she doesn't care for.

The balance between edge-of-vision shadows and DanRad's screen-centre face puts the care into scares. Scene after endless scene of Radcliffe roaming the hallways of a spooky gothic house seeking the source of creepy noises and phantasmic movements is not compelling enough for a two-hour film. The Woman in Black successfully plumbs the atmospheric vibe of The Haunting but is even more disturbing because all its bad stuff happens to little kids. Whether or not The Woman in Black provides those chills is entirely up to whatever particular type of creep-out sends shivers down your spine.  ",

While the original Mitty was a heartbreakingly sad figure, this Mitty is a weak parable for living life to the fullest (or something like that.) The Secret Life of Walter Mitty provides fun and laughs, but also meaningful thoughts on life and how we choose to live it, along with a touching lead performance you'll want to root for. Steve Conrad's script is a jumbled farce, misfiring on comedic executions and inserting beats that have no real relevance to the story. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is one charming film to see, and there's nothing wrong with a feel-good movie that makes you feel good about liking it.  ",

Summary refuses to take the suffering scribe off of the boxing beat - but the pain of being separated from his young son has weighed heavier on Erik's conscience than he could have ever imagined. When Erik sees a local homeless man (Samuel L. Jackson) being violently assaulted by a gang of sadistic street toughs he instinctively comes to the suffering man's rescue. As fate would have Erik discovers that the nondescript homeless man is actually the former boxing champion Battling Bob Satterfield whom many sports fans had assumed dead. Now driven to tell the story that may establish him as a successful sports writer Erik gradually begins to make the transformation from ordinary man to extraordinary champion - largely by turning inward and by reexamining his relationship with his own son. ~ Jason Buchanan Rovi ratings Rating 6 ContentRating PG-13  ",

But it's intelligently directed by Sam Raimi and, with all those eye-popping set pieces, it's certainly never boring.

It has been a true coming-of-age saga, in the fullest and most moving sense of the term. The final instalment, Deathly Hallows Part 2, is a bravura duel between good and evil. It's also a cathartic, occasionally clunky nostalgiafest. Come the conclusion, tears no doubt will be shed, probably by those more devoted than I. Whether they cry because of overwhelming emotion or in mourning an era's end, I'm not sure. Probably both. Radcliffe retains an endearingly owlish demeanor. But he also captures the quiet determination of a young man determined to confront his life-or-death destiny -- making the world safe for good folks, wizards and Muggles alike -- with admirable aplomb. It's a bittersweet end as the final adaptation of the beloved books hits the big screen. Expect tears, both from nostalgia and some truly amazing storytelling.  ",

It doesn't deliver as many wow moments as one might hope for, but as far as the X-Men franchise is concerned, it's one of the better installments. It's an ingenuous screenplay that's marvelously executed by Singer, whose return to the series is more than welcome. The best part of this film and the best thing to happen to the franchise as a whole is the casting of Michael Fassbender as Eric Lehnsherr/Magneto and James McAvoy as Professor Charles Xavier. X-Men: Days of Future Past builds upon the outstanding First Class by offering up an immensely fascinating and spectacularly entertaining storyline that just goes to show how far this franchise has come in recent years.

Harlin's film begins with the familiar adage that truth is the first casualty of war. Usually that phrase precedes an attempt to revive the patient, not bury it deeper in the rubble of propaganda. The plot is culled from a variety of \"war is hell but I'm covering it anyway\" journalist-in-the-field movies but handled with clich\u0329d clumsiness in a script by David Battle and doctored by Finnish writer Mikko Alanne. Flimsy dramatization of Russia/Georgia conflict fails both as historical re-enactment and as action-flick thrill ride. As propaganda, 5 Days Of War is unlikely to make a mark, though perhaps the idea of reaching people through would-be blockbusters will.  ",

The only \"Narnia\" Chronicle that's a worthy challenger to the far more popular Harry Potter pictures While \"Dawn Treader\" still had the look, it didn't feel like a Narnia film because of its meandering storyline.

The movie just unravels. It's like one of those devices for executive desks, with the stainless steel balls on the strings: It functions with great efficiency but doesn't accomplish anything. Still the best action movie I've ever seen.  ",
