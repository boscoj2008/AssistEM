From first memories through high school, including first kiss, first punch, first trip to the principal's office, and first humiliating sports experience, this is not merely an account of a highly unusual childhood. Rather, like Spinelli's fiction, its appeal lies in the accessibility and universality of his life. Entertaining and fast-paced, this is a highly readable memoir-- a must-have for Spinelli fans of all ages.

His work brought him great acclaim and, as a result of his changing affiliations in the course of a brilliant scholastic career, he is claimed by both Twelver Shi'i and Ismaili traditions. Contemplation and Action is Tusi's spiritual autobiography in which he recounts details of his early education, his search for knowledge and his eventual conversion to the Ismaili faith. Translated for the first time into English, it is published here with the full Persian text and a substantial introductory essay on Tusi's life and thought.

Exactly three months after mustering out of the Army, I found myself in the middle of one of the bloodiest race riots in U.S. history.\" Like thousands of other Black veterans in 1919, young Harry Haywood realized that, although the \"war to end all wars\" was over, the battle on the home front was still raging. A child of slaves, Harry Haywood became a pioneer theorist of Black Power and a leader of the communist movement in the thirties. Black Bolshevik is a dramatic and personal narrative of fifty years of the black struggle and the American left, including first-hand accounts of the Chicago race riot of 1919, the defense of the Scottsboro Boys, organizing sharecroppers in the South , and the Spanish Civil War. Author of the classic Negro Liberation, member of the Communist Party's Politburo and head of its Negro Department in the thirties, Haywood was expelled as a dissident in the fifties.

Katz's story begins with his parents, Russian emigres involved in theater, and discusses everything from his finding a high school that offered the possibility of drawing from antique casts, to his acceptance at the Cooper Union, his decision to become a fine artist and beyond. Katz has always steeped himself in the literature of his time, having often painted and collaborated with poets, and it is no surprise that his take on autobiography should be particularly considered and original in its composition: the entire text of \"Invented Symbols\" is in fact a transcription of the artist recounting his memories aloud, typed up by his son, poet Vincent Katz. This book revises and expands upon the 1997 Hatje Cantz edition, long out of print.

He would not allow the book to be published until after his death, so that he could speak freely, as in a love letter. In the manner in which Twain is so well-known, his autobiography is really not an autobiography at all, but a series of entertaining stories and opinions, dinner table talks, such as he had always delivered in his own home and elsewhere, and with about the same latitude and elaboration. Twain's narrative is not in any sense a mere fairy tale, many of the chapters, especially the earlier ones, are vividly true in their presentation. The things he told of Mrs. Clemens and Susy are marvelously and beautifully true in spirit and aspect, and the story as a whole is amazingly faithful in the character picture it presents of the man himself.

Kury tells the story about his election to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, and later the Senate, against the senior Republican in the House and an entrenched patronage organization. The only Democrat elected from his district to serve in the House or Senate since the Roosevelt landslide in 1936, Kury was instrumental in enacting the environmental amendment to the state constitution, a comprehensive clean streams law, the gubernatorial disability law, reform of the Senate s procedure for confirmation of gubernatorial appointments, a new public utility law, and flood plain and storm water management laws. The story told here is based on Kury s recollections of his experience, supplemented by his personal files, extensive research in the legislative archives, and conversations with persons knowledgeable on the issues. This book is well documented with notes and appendices of significant documents. Several chapters provide detailed inside descriptions of how campaigns succeeded and the enactment of legislation happened. The passage of the environmental amendment, clean streams law, public utility code, flood plain and storm water management laws, and the gubernatorial disability law are recounted in a manner that reveals what it takes to pass such proposals. The book concludes with the author s reflections on the legislature s historical legacies, its present operation, and its future.\" ISBN 1611460735 ISBN13 9781611460735 PageCount 274 FirstAuthor Franklin L.

As a fabulist, his stature equals that of Gunter Grass, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Italo Calvino, Milan Kundera, and John Barth. As an iconoclast in contemporary cultural criticism, he has been likened to Roland Barthes. The Wind Spirit is a literary/intellectual autobiography of extraorinary grace and intelligence, and yet the play of the author's ideas - and of his wicked wit - gives the book a depth and resonane that transcend the boudaries of the genre. Although the six essays that make up the book are ostensibly structured around the author's childhood, education, and the creation of his major works of fiction, they branch out to gice us fascinating glimpses of life in Frnace before and during World War II, of the frenetic bustle of postwar Europe, and of famous personalities such as Jean-Paul Sartre. Equally compelling are Tournier's fresh and controversial views on the topics of sexuality, education, and the uneasy relationship between French and German thought. For those unfamiliar with Tournier, The Wind Spirit provides and ideal introduction to one of Europe's foremost literary figures and to a brilliant body of work. Those who know and admire the author's novels will find here both a source of keen pleasure and an indispensable account of Tournier's creative development.

These memoirs encompass her reporting from, inter alia, Northern Ireland, the Middle East, Tiananmen Square and, of course, the Gulf War of 1991. From the siege at the Iranian embassy which shot her to public acclaim, to an alarming encounter with a drunken Libyan army commander who shot her at point-blank range, from the chaos and mayhem of desert warfare to Gracie Field's bizarre funeral, Kate has cooly kept us in touch through her reasoned and level reporting. Although an intensely private person, Kate Adie also divulges how, despite being sent to outlandish places at a moment's notice, she's maintained her interest in sailing, singing, and theatre, and what it's like to be a woman in a man's world.

        "input": "Entity 1: ID 3399 Title Diana: A Strange Autobiography Description This is the unusual and compelling story of Diana, a tantalizingly beautiful woman who sought love in the strange by-paths of Lesbos. Fearless and outspoken, it dares to reveal that hidden world where perfumed caresses and half-whispered endearments constitute the forbidden fruits in a Garden of Eden where men are never accepted. This is how \"Diana: A Strange Autobiography\" was described when it was published in paperback in 1952. The original 1939 hardcover edition carried with it a Publisher's Note: This is the autobiography of a woman who tried to be normal. In the book, Diana is presented as the unexceptional daughter of an unexceptional plutocratic family. During adolescence, she finds herself drawn with mysterious intensity to a girl friend. The narrative follows Diana's progress through college; a trial marriage that proves she is incapable of heterosexuality; intellectual and sexual education in Europe; and a series of lesbian relationships culminating in a final tormented triangular struggle with two other women for the individual salvation to be found in a happy couple. In her introduction, Julie Abraham argues that Diana is not really an autobiography at all, but a deliberate synthesis of different archetypes of this confessional genre, echoing, as it does, more than a half-dozen novels. Hitting all the high and low points of the lesbian novel, the book, Abraham illustrates, offers a defense of lesbian relationships that was unprecedented in 1939 and radical for decades afterwards.

By age 16, Pat Martino was already working as a member of R&B star Lloyd Price's touring musical revue. By age 18, Martino moved to Harlem, where he quickly earned a reputation as a hard-bopping six-stringer with formidable chops through a series of apprenticeships with the likes of honking tenor saxophonist Willis \"Gaitor Tail\" Jackson and Hammond B-3 organ master Jack McDuff. Martino made his auspicious debut as a leader at age 22 with 1967's El Hombre on Prestige and followed with a string of potent recordings for the label that further established him as one of the most distinctive guitar voices on the jazz scene. Then, at the peak of his powers, the bottom fell out. In 1980, he underwent surgery as the result of a nearly fatal brain aneurysm. The surgery left him without any memory of the guitar or his musical career. From that point, Martino undertook the long process of recovery, eventually learning how to play the guitar again; but more important, learning to transcend the instrument itself and live his life completely in the moment. More than just the remarkable story of one of the most original and profoundly influential guitarists in jazz history, this extraordinarily revealing autobiography is also a survival manual, of sorts, in overcoming incredible adversity and learning to live in the here and now.

But as bass player of Blur\u2014one of the most successful British bands of all time\u2014his journey was more exciting and extreme than he could ever have predicted. Success catapulted him from a slug-infested squat in Camberwell to a world of private jets and world-class restaurants. As \"the second drunkest member of the world\u2019s drunkest band\" Alex James's life was always chaotic, but he retained a boundless enthusiasm and curiosity at odds with his hedonistic lifestyle. From nights in the Groucho with Damien Hirst, to dancing to Sister Sledge with Bj\u00f6rk, to being bitten on the nose by the lead singer of Iron Maiden, he offers a fascinating and hilarious insight into the world of celebrity. At its heart, however, this is the picaresque tale of one man\u2019s search to find meaning and happiness in an increasingly surreal world. Pleasingly unrepentant but nonetheless a reformed man, Alex James is the perfect chronicler of his generation\u2014witty, frank and brimming with joie de vivre. A Bit of a Blur is as charming, funny, and deliciously disreputable as its author.

After leaving school at 14, he started his career as a greengrocer at the New Covent Garden market, and went on to create his multi-million pound fruit and veg business a decade later. A star slot on BBC Veg Talk and an award-winning television program followed, and, in 2005, the chance to front Masterchef , a show that has drawn in over 4.5 million viewers and produced some of the nation's best up-and-coming chefs. He has since opened two restaurants, Wallace & Co and Gregg's Table, penned numerous cookery books, and has written for the national and trade press. In this, his first memoir, Gregg tells how his early passion for food growing up in Peckham, south London, led to a world of Michelin star restaurants, celebrity chefs, and a mission to save Britain's produce and, in an extraordinary turn with more than a few life-changing hurdles, brought him back to his roots.

Where White Men Fear to Tread is the well-detailed, first-hand story of his life so far, in which he has done everything possible to dramatize and justify the Native American aim of self-determination, such as storming Mount Rushmore, seizing Plymouth Rock, running for President in 1988, and--most notoriously--leading a 71-day takeover of Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in 1973. This visionary autobiography by one of our most magnetic personalities will fascinate, educate, and inspire.

In the wake of the Second Vatican Council 1962-1965 many religious people, especially those serving in Latin America, began to understand a spirituality that transcended sectarianism. Having come from an upwardly mobile Italian American family marked by Southern Italian anti-clericalism, Blase was accustomed to hearing his parents express real differences with their institutional church. He went into the seminary despite the avid protests of his parents. Blase\u2019s odyssey takes us from his high school and college years, through his service in Guatemala during a violent revolution, to his expulsion from that country for \u201csubversion.\u201d After receiving gag order from the Church, which he could not in good conscience accept, Blase met with the editorial board of the Washington Post and released all of the material he had regarding the U.S. military presence in Guatemala. This action led to his separation from the Maryknoll Fathers. Blase accepted a teaching post at UCLA. While serving in academia, he met the former Maryknoll Sister Theresa Killeen, who had served in Southern Chile. They married in 1970. Their adventures include working directly with Cesar Chavez at his headquarters in La Paz, California, building solidarity with the Central American Revolution, forming the Office of the Americas, working in the forefront of the international movement for justice and peace, and raising two children. Blase worked on the ground for international peace in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Cuba, Japan and Iraq. He led the U.S. contingent of the International March for Peace in Central America from Panama to Mexico in 1985-1986.

        "input": "Entity 1: ID 2519 Title Antonin Raymond: An Autobiography Description As the first architect to synthesize traditional Japanese forms and ideas with the new design philosophy of the West, Antonin Raymond has been a major creative force during a great part of this century. Raymond, as a young graduate architect, had journeyed from his native Bohemia to the United States in search of the new world of architecture heralded by the achievements of Frank Lloyd Wright. He met and worked with Wright at his Taliesin home, but did not find in America the creative milieu he sought. Accompanying Wright to Japan to assist in planning and building the Imperial Hotel, Raymond responded strongly to the beauty of traditional Japanese architecture and art. In 1921, the 32-year-old Raymond began his career as an independent architect in Tokyo, adapting new technologies to the universal principles embodied in Japanese forms. Over the years, he revolutionized the arts of design and construction in Japan and created many works which now rank as milestones of modern architecture. Architecture is not the only medium in which he has distinguished himself; Raymond is an accomplished painter, sculptor and musician. As this book reveals, Raymond has been impelled toward the central events of our century. Serving as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Expeditionary Force in World War I, he was present at the inception of the Czechoslovak nation. Decorated by many governments, he was a Czechoslovak consul in pre-World War II Tokyo. Returning to that city in 1945, he witnessed its painful recovery from the devastation of the war as, earlier, he had witnessed the Great Kanto Earthquake and its aftermath. Fascinating people appear in these pages. Frank Lloyd Wright, a giant presence, is vividly depicted as a warm friend and exacting mentor, a respected colleague and a wrathful adversary. Here, too, are the poet Paul Claude, the composer Igor Stravinsky, painters and architects like Le Corbusier, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant, Taro Okamoto, Kenzo Tange, and many others. Mrs. Raymond, a distinguished painter and designer, has contributed much to the Raymond style, and her presence enlivens and enriches this account. This book will be absorbing, entertaining reading for anyone interested in the important artistic developments of our century. including 37 color plates, more than 600 black-and-white plates and illustrations, over 100 plans ISBN 0804810443 ISBN13 9780804810449 PageCount 328 FirstAuthor Antonin Raymond SecondAuthor   ThirdAuthor   Rating 4.0 NumberofRatings 1 NumberofReviews 0 Publisher Tuttle Publishing PublishDate 1973 Format Hardcover Language English FileName 3270-1391809.Antonin_Raymond.html   Entity 2: title Antonin Raymond: An Autobiography Pages 328 authors Antonin Raymond publication_info Publisher Tuttle Publishing ISBN13 9780804810449 PublicationDate 01/01/1972  ",

From her abuse at the hands of a family member to her present-day life in Barcelona, where she briefly moonlighted as a dubber of Italian pornography into English, Matthews reveals herself to be a darkly funny, deeply contemporary woman with a keen awareness of how her body has been routinely hijacked, and how she has been \u201cformatted\u201d by her early trauma. Her story is a study of her uneasy relationships with female desire, her tormentors, and her lovers\u2014with whom she seeks out both the infliction and receipt of harm. This book is an attempt, sometimes self-thwarted, to break down barriers: sexual and emotional for Matthews, literary for Shields. For them, the only response to the unspeakable is to speak, to do that thing you do with your mouth, as directly and honestly as possible. Their provocative performance refuses neat resolution or emotional pornography; it will have readers, from literary critics to Jezebel commentators, raving, raging, celebrating, talking.

Soon after abandoning his native New York in the 1960s to pursue his career in the UK, Visconti found himself in the thick of the emerging glam rock movement. His first commercial success came with T.Rex, but it was with the then-unknown David Bowie that Visconti made his mark on the music scene. He has since worked with dozens of famous artists, among them Thin Lizzy, Morrissey, Iggy Pop, U2, and Wings.

        "input": "Entity 1: ID 488 Title General George Crook: His Autobiography Description General George Crook was one Civil War general who didn\u2019t win his reputation east of the Mississippi River. To him, the Civil War was just an interlude. Before and after this great conflict, Crook was an Indian fighter. Crook fought the greatest of the Indian chieftains; served at frontier posts from the Columbia River to the Rio Grande, from Illinois to the Pacific. Yet he was as good at defending Indians as he was at fighting them. Crook understood and sympathized with them. He spoke plainly and often against injustices in the treatment of the Indian. And when he died, Red Cloud, chief of the Sioux, gave him his epitaph: \u201cHe, at least, had never lied to us.\u201d General George Crook: His Autobiography first came into print when Martin F. Schmitt, working in the archives of the Army War College in Washington, made the startling rediscovery of the Crook papers, which had been presented to the library of the War College by the widow of Walter S. Schuyler, one-time aid to General Crook. The existence of the autobiography had apparently not been previously suspected by any writer on the West, not even by the General\u2019s friend, Captain John G. Bourke, who wrote the only existing sketch of his life. A West Point graduate of 1852, General Crook spent his entire military career, with the exception of the four Civil War years, 1861 to 1865, on the frontier. His life paralleled western expansion during the latter half of the nineteenth century. In 1890, at the time of this death, he was commanding general of the Department of the Missouri, the largest and most active of all frontier commands. The Rogue River and Yakima wars in the eighteen fifties, Paiute pacification in the late sixties, the Apache campaigns of the seventies and eighties\u2014all found Crook actively involved, fighting, counseling and making peace with the Indians. His Civil War experiences, while not uniformly successful or profitable, brought him into close contact with the great military figures of the day. He was a favorite of Grant\u2019s and a close associate of Sheridan, who had been in his class at West Point. His blunt, sometimes caustic opinions of his associates and the conduct of campaigns are new and often refreshing. General Crook\u2019s autobiography covers the period from Crook\u2019s graduation from West Point in 1852 to June 18, 1876, the day after the famous Battle of the Rosebud. The editor has supplemented it with other material, some from the Crook diaries and letters and contemporary clippings, on the other years of the General\u2019s life.

This is a candid account of Betty Boothroyd\u2019s life in politics, and she speaks frankly of the devastation of losing two elections, of campaigning for JFK in America, and the elation she felt on finally becoming an MP in 1973. But her long political career reached its apogee in 1992 when she was appointed the first woman Speaker of the House of Commons. Detailing many of the true stories behind the headlines, she writes of the sleaze scandals that beset the Major government, her feelings when Labour won their landslide election in 1997, and her strongly held views on the role of Parliament.

St. Teresa wrote this memoir at the behest of her confessor. It offers a warm, accessible account of her transformation into an impassioned leader and reformer of church doctrine. St. Teresa recounts her childhood and education in sixteenth-century Spain, her physical afflictions and spiritual crises, her many visions and mystical encounters, and her determination to embrace the contemplative life. In describing the ascent of the soul, she explains the core of her theology as a four-stage process that progresses from mental prayer to divine rapture. Next to Don Quixote, this timeless work constitutes Spain's most popular prose classic. It forms an excellent introduction to the saint's other writings and to the Christian tradition of mystical literature.

This volume offers an irresistible opportunity to see who this remarkable man really was. Chesterton was one of the most stimulating and well-loved writers of the 20th century. His 100 books, and hundreds of essays and columns on a great variety of themes have made G.K. Chesterton the most widely quoted writers of modern times. Here is Chesterton in his own words, in a book he preferred not to write, but did so near the end of his life after much insistence by friends and admirers. Critic Sydney Dark wrote after Chesterton died that perhaps the happiest thing that happened in Gilbert Chesterton's extraordinarily happy life was that his autobiography was finished a few weeks before his death. It is a stimulating, exciting, tremendously interesting book. It is a draught - indeed, ISBN 1586170716 ISBN13 9781586170714 PageCount 336 FirstAuthor G.K.

Since 1999, when he made his international debut, there has been no greater player in world rugby than Brian O'Driscoll. In 2010 Rugby World magazine named him its world player of the decade - and since then the legend has only grown. Now, at the end of his amazing career - which culminated in fairy-tale fashion with Ireland's victory in the 2014 Six Nations championship - he tells his own story. Honest, gritty and thoughtful, Brian O'Driscoll's Autobiography is not just an essential sports book. It is an essential book about family, friends, hard work, courage and imagination. \"An amazing career. There will only ever be one BOD\". (Dan Carter). \"A thoroughly enjoyable read ...After reading The Test I warmed even more to O'Driscoll as a player and a man. He stood for a new ethos in Irish sport that refused to accept mediocrity or glorious failure\".

Three years later he was the first British player ever to clinch the Masters, playing one of the most famous shots of all time to secure victory. But at the height of Lyle's success, his swing began to fail but his refusal to give up earned him admiration and respect from the golfing public.

My dad would say to me as a teenager, \"Don't tell your mother.\" We couldn't face the disapproval.' Sue Johnston always seemed to be disappointing her mother. As a girl she never stayed clean and tidy like her cousins. As she grew older, she spent all her piano lesson money on drinks for her mates down the pub, and when she discovered the Cavern she was never at home. The final straw was when Sue left her steady job at a St. Helens factory to try her hand at the unsteadiest of jobs: acting. Yet when Sue was bringing up her own child alone, her mother was always there to help. And playing her much-loved characters Sheila Grant and Barbara Royle - although her mum wouldn't say she was proud as such, she certainly seemed to approve. And in her mother's final months, it was Sue she needed by her side. The relationship with your mother is perhaps the most precious and fraught of any woman's life. When she began writing, Sue set out to record, \"All the big things, and all the small things. Everything I wanted to tell my mother but felt I never could.\" The result is a warm, poignant, and often very funny memoir by one of our favorite actresses.

        "input": "Entity 1: ID 839 Title The Life of St. Teresa of Jesus: Autobiography Description Teresa of Avila, also called Saint Teresa of Jesus, baptized as Teresa Sanchez de Cepeda y Ahumada, (March 28, 1515 - October 4, 1582) was a prominent Spanish mystic, Roman Catholic saint, Carmelite nun, writer of the Counter Reformation, and theologian of contemplative life through mental prayer. She was a reformer of the Carmelite Order and is considered to be a founder of the Discalced Carmelites along with John of the Cross. In 1622, forty years after her death, she was canonized by Pope Gregory XV and was in 1970 named a Doctor of the Church by Pope Paul VI. Her books, which include her autobiography (The Life of Teresa of Jesus) and her seminal work El Castillo Interior (The Interior Castle) are an integral part of Spanish Renaissance literature as well as Christian mysticism and Christian meditation practices as she entails in her other important work, Camino de Perfeccion (The Way of Perfection). Readers interested in basic Christian mysticism need look no further than Saint Teresa of Avila. Theresa expresses in beautiful language her deep relationship with God, and her words of wisdom and ever-hopeful outlook have inspired Christians everywhere for centuries. The Spanish Carmelite nun's autobiography provides a perfect entrance point to the world of mental prayer. She begins her story with tales of her childhood in the early 1500s--the death of her mother, how she became a nun, and the hardships of her life including illness and a period of \"lukewarmness\" during which she ceased to pray. St. Teresa also relates the visiosn and instructions she recieved form God later in her life. This book also contains St. Teresa's writings on the four states of mental prayer. In the first stage, believers learn to pray. In the second, they experience the supernatural aspect of prayer. In the third, the soul is bathed inthe pleasure of God's presence, and in the fourth, senses are abandonded in a sort of out-of-body experience where the sould feels only divine union. This book also contains a series of \"relations,\" letters she send to colleagues giving further thoughts of her beliefs. St. Teresa's warm and personal descriptions of union with God provide a wonderful and accessible starting point for engagement in her life and theology of mysticism.

Individually and collectively, these writers and performers speak the unspoken and perform the heretofore unperformed. The first section includes scripts and essays about performances of the lives of Gertrude Stein, Georgia O'Keeffe, Mary Church Terrell, Charlotte Cushman, Ana\u00efs Nin, Calamity Jane, and Mary Martin. The essays consider intriguing interpretive issues that arise when a woman performer represents another woman's life. In the second section, seven performers\u2014Tami Spry, Jacqueline Taylor, Linda Park-Fuller, Joni Jones, Terri Galloway, Linda M. Montano, and Laila Farah\u2014tell their own stories. Ranging from narrrative lectures (sometimes aided by slides and props) to theatrical performances, their works wrest comic and dramatic meaning from a world too often chaotic and painful. Their performances engage issues of sexual orientation, ethnicity, race, loss of parent, disability, life and death, and war and peace. The volume as a whole highlights issues of representation, identity, and staging in autobiographical performance. It examines the links among theory and criticism of women's autobiography, feminist performance theory, and performance practice.

        "input": "Entity 1: ID 2704 Title Antonin Raymond: An Autobiography Description As the first architect to synthesize traditional Japanese forms and ideas with the new design philosophy of the West, Antonin Raymond has been a major creative force during a great part of this century. Raymond, as a young graduate architect, had journeyed from his native Bohemia to the United States in search of the new world of architecture heralded by the achievements of Frank Lloyd Wright. He met and worked with Wright at his Taliesin home, but did not find in America the creative milieu he sought. Accompanying Wright to Japan to assist in planning and building the Imperial Hotel, Raymond responded strongly to the beauty of traditional Japanese architecture and art. In 1921, the 32-year-old Raymond began his career as an independent architect in Tokyo, adapting new technologies to the universal principles embodied in Japanese forms. Over the years, he revolutionized the arts of design and construction in Japan and created many works which now rank as milestones of modern architecture. Architecture is not the only medium in which he has distinguished himself; Raymond is an accomplished painter, sculptor and musician. As this book reveals, Raymond has been impelled toward the central events of our century. Serving as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Expeditionary Force in World War I, he was present at the inception of the Czechoslovak nation. Decorated by many governments, he was a Czechoslovak consul in pre-World War II Tokyo. Returning to that city in 1945, he witnessed its painful recovery from the devastation of the war as, earlier, he had witnessed the Great Kanto Earthquake and its aftermath. Fascinating people appear in these pages. Frank Lloyd Wright, a giant presence, is vividly depicted as a warm friend and exacting mentor, a respected colleague and a wrathful adversary. Here, too, are the poet Paul Claude, the composer Igor Stravinsky, painters and architects like Le Corbusier, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant, Taro Okamoto, Kenzo Tange, and many others. Mrs. Raymond, a distinguished painter and designer, has contributed much to the Raymond style, and her presence enlivens and enriches this account. This book will be absorbing, entertaining reading for anyone interested in the important artistic developments of our century. including 37 color plates, more than 600 black-and-white plates and illustrations, over 100 plans ISBN 0804810443 ISBN13 9780804810449 PageCount 328 FirstAuthor Antonin Raymond SecondAuthor   ThirdAuthor   Rating 4.0 NumberofRatings 1 NumberofReviews 0 Publisher Tuttle Publishing PublishDate 1973 Format Hardcover Language English FileName 3439-1391809.Antonin_Raymond.html   Entity 2: title Antonin Raymond: An Autobiography Pages 328 authors Antonin Raymond publication_info Publisher Tuttle Publishing ISBN13 9780804810449 PublicationDate 01/01/1972  ",

        "input": "Entity 1: ID 1049 Title As If: An Autobiography Description As If: An Autobiography traces the complex life and career of director, scholar, and theorist Herbert Blau, one of the most innovative voices in the American theater. From his earliest years on the streets of Brooklyn, with gang wars there, to the often embattled, now-legendary Actor's Workshop of San Francisco, the powerfully told story of Blau's first four decades is also a social history, moving from the Great Depression to the cold war, with fallout from \"the balance of terror\" on what he once described in an incendiary manifesto as The Impossible Theater. Blau has always forged his own path, from his activist resistance to the McCarthy witch hunts to his emergence as a revolutionary director whose work included the controversial years at The Workshop, which introduced American audiences to major playwrights of the European avant-garde, including Brecht, Beckett, Genet, and Pinter. There is also an account here of that notorious production of Waiting for Godot at the maximum-security prison at San Quentin, which became the insignia of the Theater of the Absurd. Blau went on from The Workshop to become codirector of the Repertory Theater of Lincoln Center, and then founding provost of California Institute of the Arts, where he developed and became artistic director of the experimental group KRAKEN. Currently Byron W. and Alice L. Lockwood Professor of the Humanities at the University of Washington, Blau has been visionary in the passage from theater to theory, and his many influential and award-winning books include The Dubious Spectacle: Extremities of Theater, 1976\u20132000; Sails of the Herring Fleet: Essays on Beckett; Nothing in Itself: Complexions of Fashion; To All Appearances: Ideology and Performance; The Audience; The Eye of Prey: Subversions of the Postmodern; and Take Up the Bodies: Theater at the Vanishing Point. This richly evocative book includes never-before-published photographs of the author, his family and friends, collaborators in the theater, and theater productions.

But as a teenager he developed a passion for music that set him on a very different path, and ultimately led to super stardom. It wasn't, however, an easy start. Scraping a living on the edges of show business was a hard slog, and he endured many disappointments. Then aged 23, he went along to an audition for a new musical called Godspell and won the role of Jesus that was to shoot him to fame. Within a year he was starring in smash hit film, That'll Be the Day , and had written and recorded his first number one single \"Rock On.\" It was the start of Essex Mania, and a long journey of undreamt-of adventure. From Godspell to EastEnders it's been an amazing life, and here is David's full incredible story\u2014in his own words.

Elizabeth was taken in his spaceship to Meton, where she lived with him and his family for four months and where she bore his child. Her life on Meton is fascinatingly described. Akon brought Elizabeth back to Earth after the birth of their son, and continued to visit her thereafter. Akon explained how his spaceship's light-propulsion technology operated, and how it allowed him and his people to travel across vast interstellar distances. This technology is explained in detail in the book. Elizabeth was given a standing ovation at the 11th International Congress of UFO Research Groups at Weisbaden in 1975, and her speech as guest of honor was applauded by scientists of twenty-two nations. Light Technology Publishing is proud to bring you the long-awaited American edition in both hard copy and electronic format of Beyond the Light Barrier, which was first published in English in 1980.

        "input": "Entity 1: ID 2478 Title The Autobiography of Frau Adolf Hitler: Translated and Edited by Frank Sanello Description In his new novel, Frank Sanello vividly recreates the Third Reich and World War II as seen through the eyes and daily diary of Hitler's imaginary wife, Countess Christina Bernadotte (1916-1948). The granddaughter of the king of Sweden, the countess is forced at the age of 16 to marry the 43-year-old Nazi dictator by her socially ambitious and abusive mother, an heiress to the Vanderbilt fortune. Her husband, strung out on morphine and cocaine, makes revolting sexual demands on his virginal wife involving coprophilia, a fetish that eroticizes feces. Lonely and isolated, Frau Hitler throws herself into a series of transient love affairs with the Third Reich's handsome foreign minister, the corrupt Joachim von Ribbentrop, Cary Grant, and Ernst Rohm, leader of the SA (Storm Troopers). Because of her many romantic liaisons, she doesn't know the identity of the father of her son, Folke, except that he's not her husband's. As the Holocaust claims more victims, Christina begins smuggling Jews out of Germany right under her drug-addled husband's nose. During the war, she travels to Auschwitz to rescue Jewish friends and bribes the Gestapo to allow other Jews to flee Nazi Germany. With her uncle, Count Folke Bernadotte, she helps organize the White Buses operation, a dangerous mission that transports 30,000 Jews and POWs to safety in Sweden aboard Red Cross buses painted white to avoid bombing the Allies or the Luftwaffe. As First Lady of the Reich, she meets or corresponds with various historical figures such as Sigmund Freud, Pope Pius XII and MGM chief Louis B. Mayer. Toward the end of the war, as she tries to flee home to Sweden with her son and adopted daughter, her arch-nemesis, Hermann Goring, Hitler's second in command and pedophile, forces her to choose one of her children to leave behind with him. The choice haunts the countess until tragedy intervenes during her work as UN mediator between warring Palestinian Jews and Arabs in 1948. These dramatic events are recorded in her daily diary, which her grandson finds hidden in a Holocaust memorial library and publishes as \"The Autobiography of Frau Adolf Hitler.\" ISBN 1477581723 ISBN13 9781477581728 PageCount 252 FirstAuthor Frank Sanello SecondAuthor   ThirdAuthor   Rating 4.67 NumberofRatings 3 NumberofReviews 3 Publisher Createspace PublishDate June 1st 2012 Format Paperback Language English FileName 3243-15891360-the-autobiography-of-frau-adolf-hitler.html   Entity 2: title The Autobiography of Frau Adolf Hitler Pages 252 Productdimensions 6.00(w) x 9.00(h) x 0.53(d) Salesrank 1,098,855 authors Frank Sanello publication_info Publisher CreateSpace Publishing ISBN13 9781477581728 PublicationDate 06/22/2012  ",

He describes the years of hard work, the arduous training, the frustrations, triumphs, and disappointments before he was accepted into the New York City Ballet. He details the fast-paced life of his tour with the company in Russia, where as a sixteen-year-old he danced for Khrushchev on the eve of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Robert's story is one of many contrasts-of hope and despair, of love and sorrow, and of the two worlds in which he moved: the gang-ridden Brooklyn of the fifties and the brilliant, demanding, exciting world of the ballet.

In a volume that continues to resonate more than seventy years after its initial publication, Frank Lloyd Wright: An Autobiography contains the master architect's own account of his work, his philosophy, and his personal life, written with his signature wit and charm. Wright (1867-1959) went into seclusion in a Minnesota cabin to reflect and to record his life experiences. In 1932, the first edition of the Autobiography was published. It became a form of advertising, leading many readers to seek out the master architect--thirty apprentices came to live and learn at Taliesin, Wright's Wisconsin home/school/studio, under the master's tutelage. (By 1938, Taliesin West, in Arizona, was the winter location for Wright's school.) The volume is divided into five sections devoted to family, fellowship, work, freedom, and form. Wright recalls his childhood, his apprenticeship with Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan, the turmoil of his personal life, and the background to his greatest achievements, including Hollyhock House, the Prairie and the Usonian Houses, and the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo.

Within two years of his 2008 Test debut, he had become his country's most reliable bowler, made the shortlist for the ICC's cricketer of the year award and claimed an Ashes-sealing wicket. Yet the script took many twists and turns along the way. Drafted into the squad for the full tour of South Africa in 1999-2000. Swann's meteoric received a jolt. While some liked the cut of his jib, others did not and England coach Duncan Fletcher already had a foot in the latter camp when Swann missed the bus for the first of two times on that tour. Suddenly he was judged on temperament and not talent. Although Swann candidly concedes he was nowhere near good enough for the top level at that stage in his career, his jettisoning back to county cricket for the next seven years, following a solitary one-day international, hinted at a career wasted. A clash with then Northamptonshire coach Kepler Wessels triggered his move to Nottinghamshire in 2005. A County Championship winner in his debut season, he was back in the England fold at the end of his third. Forever a flamboyant showman, he made up for lost time with two wickets in his first over against India - his habit of striking in his opening over a spell has become a party piece. You cannot keep the spotlight off him for long. Since moving into the top 10 of the world rankings for bowlers on the back of eight wickets in the Ashes-defining Oval Test of 2009, he has not dropped outside it, and has been widely tipped to be the decisive factor in the defence of the urn in Australia.

It was both auspicious and unlucky -- her son, the fortune-teller said, would grow up with no brothers, and his father's health would be endangered by his birth. That son, however, would have a distinguished career, after going through many misfortunes and dangers.The dream was prophetic. The child was his mother's only male child and his father died of illness when the boy was only five. He grew up during the wartime and period of political turmoil in China, passing through many troubles, and he has had a very distinguished career. He is Yang Xianyi, renowned scholar, translator and interpreter of Chinese and Western literature. This delightful memoir of Yang Xianyi gives a candid and entertaining account of himself as a lighthearted and mischievous young man who immersed himself in the learning of European culture, ancient and modern, when he studied at Oxford in the 1930s. But it is also the illuminating self-portrait of a deeply patriotic intellectual living in a China under the throes of change, giving rare insight into the survival of a courageous, witty and principled individual during the harsh century of Chinese liberation.

He has won a record-holding eleven World Championship titles and ten Commonwealth Games gold medals. He has broken twenty-two world records and won five gold, three silver and one bronze Olympic medals. Having been under the spotlight since he was a young teenager, Thorpe retired from competitive swimming in 2006 because of the intense pressure he felt, but five years later he decided to make a hugely publicised comeback. Ian is one of the world's most successful sportsmen, but it is the way he has managed his triumphs and his commitment to helping others that have earned him respect and admiration internationally. Thorpe's autobiography follows him all the way from his childhood in Sydney right up to the London Olympics.This is a man who has had highs and lows away from the pool, who has led an extraordinary life of an elite athlete that most of us will never know, who has faced up to his own demons, and who has the courage to come back and stake his claim for the ultimate goal once more.

Born in Texas and raised in Arizona, Buck eventually found his way to Bakersfield, California. Unlike the vast majority of country singers, songwriters, and musicians who made their fortunes working and living in Nashville, the often rebellious and always independent Owens chose to create his own brand of country music some 2,000 miles away from Music City racking up a remarkable twenty-one number one hits along the way. In the process he helped give birth to a new country sound and did more than any other individual to establish Bakersfield as a country music center. In the latter half of the 1990s, Buck began working on his autobiography. Over the next few years, he talked into the microphone of a cassette tape machine for nearly one hundred hours, recording the story of his life. With his near-photographic memory, Buck recalled everything from his early days wearing hand-me-down clothes in Texas to his glory years as the biggest country star of the 1960s; from his legendary Carnegie Hall concert to his multiple failed marriages; from his hilarious exploits on the road to the tragic loss of his musical partner and best friend, Don Rich; from his days as the host of a local TV show in Tacoma, Washington, to his co-hosting the network television show Hee Haw; and from his comeback hit, \"Streets of Bakersfield,\" to his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame. In these pages, Buck also shows his astute business acumen, having been among the first country artists to create his own music publishing company. He also tells of negotiating the return of all of his Capitol master recordings, his acquisition of numerous radio stations, and of his conceiving and building the Crystal Palace, one of the most venerated musical venues in the country. Buck 'Em! is the fascinating story of the life of country superstar Buck Owens from the back roads of Texas to the streets of Bakersfield. Click here to watch a video extra on YouTube for Buck 'Em.

Dr. Ralph David Abernathy\u0097Martin Luther King Jr.'s partner and eventual successor\u0097not only tells his own story but also expounds on the leaders he knew intimately, including King, Jesse Jackson, Andrew Young, and Lyndon Johnson, among others. Revealing the planning that went into major protests and the negotiations that brought them to a close, Abernathy chronicles a movement, recalling the bitter defeats they faced, the misery and deaths they suffered. Amidst these struggles, though, he celebrates the victories that integrated communities, gave economic and political power to the disenfranchised, and brought hope to people who had not dreamed of it. Throughout, Abernathy's close relationship with King is central to the story\u0097and to the civil rights movement. In 1956, when Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus, it was Abernathy who enlisted King to join the protest. Together, they led the landmark bus boycott for 381 days, during which Abernathy\u2019s house was bombed and his church dynamited. From there, the two helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and they were jailed together more than 40 times. Their protests and marches took them all over the South\u0097Selma, Albany, Birmingham\u0097and to Washington and Chicago as well. An unsung hero of his era, Abernathy's inspiring memoir ultimately shows how their victories, and even their setbacks, led to social and legislative changes across the entire country.

        "input": "Entity 1: ID 1152 Title The Autobiography of Alexander Luria: A Dialogue with the Making of Mind Description Alexander Luria was one of the most influential psychologists of the 20th century. His official autobiography was written as a citizen of the Soviet Union, and while it provides a compelling story of his lifelong devotion to developing a comprehensive theory of the biological and cultural foundations of human nature, it is conspicuous for the absence of information about the social context of his work and his personal struggles to be a decent person in indecent times. The current \"dialogic autobiography\" brings the vitality of Luria's ideas back to life. Michael Cole and Karl Levitin, both of whom knew Luria well and have written about his life and work, have written a carefully researched introduction and epilogue to the original autobiography. They provide readers, for the first time, with information about the social and personal contexts of Luria's remarkable achievements.

Living in the vivacious and eccentric community of New Hope, Pa, in the 1970s and 1980s, she very much reflected that town's character. Yet another place, Wales, the land of her forefathers, ever kept a spiritual hold on her, beckoning her homeward through the most unexpected of mechanisms (e.g. scents, strolls along a canal, animals, family and friends) until she discovers who she really is and the redemptive power of the cross. Her son, H. R. Jakes, a writer who lives in Texas, compiled her story. He has been writing all his life, and she thus felt confident to entrust him with that task. Through him, further books in this series will be forthcoming, first among them Curious Recipes: the Mostly Welsh Cookbook of Elaine Jakes, a charming (and tasty) combination of Elaine's tales with detailed recipes, featuring as an aspect of every vignette the story behind each culinary delight. H. R. Jakes is married to Diana, whom he met in Italy in 1979. They have 7 children and one grandchild, in whose eyes it is evident to one and all that Elaine's legacy lives on.

This critical edition of her memoirs makes her story available to readers for the first time. Beginning with her lovingly recounted memories of growing up in Liberia, it follows her to Hamburg, Germany, where she pursued an education and forged friendships, but also experienced the racism, terror, and nationalistic fervor that accompanied the Nazis' rise to power. In the face of these mounting dangers, Massaquoi traveled to the United States, where she furthered her studies, embracing her newfound freedom even as she observed deteriorating conditions in the segregated American South in the early years of the civil rights movement. Spanning continents and cultures, this narrative introduces us to a truly remarkable woman while offering a fascinating window into the complex history of the twentieth century.

Listening to the various scientific bodies located around our world, I contemplate their submissions of doom. The diversity of opinion seems, at times, contradictory, and yet as Earth reveals in her changing moods a threat to humanity's future, the majority of us continue to ignore her warning. There are two over-powering reasons that should influence us to pause and rethink the strategy to live our lives here. First is the transient aspect of it, second, our inevitable transition into the next world when it ends. 'Sixty Psychic Years' describes a life-time of psychic experiences I have witnessed both from seances, held by my mother; a practicing spiritual medium over that period, and many inexplicable events that have occurred throughout my life.

Much more than simply their manager, confidant, and group guru, Epstein helped create a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon. A Cellarful of Noise , Epstein's long out-of-print autobiography, gives readers the inside story of his discovery and management of the world's most famous rock 'n' roll band. From their initial struggles to their wild rocket ride to the pinnacle of success, this true story includes How a request for a record led to the discovery of the Beatles; Why Ringo Starr replaced the original Beatle drummer; How Paul McCartney was nearly blinded by a fan; and hundreds of other fascinating little-known facts of Epstein's life with the Beatles, Gerry and the Pacemakers, and other top stars. This new edition of A Cellarful of Noise features an introduction by world-renowned Beatles expert Martin Lewis, which, along with Epstein's own words, creates a compelling insightful exploration of the life and times of a gifted man who had an ear for genius.

Published to rave reviews, the Autobiography was hailed as the capstone of Twain\u2019s career. It captures his authentic and unsuppressed voice, speaking clearly from the grave and brimming with humor, ideas, and opinions. The eagerly-awaited Volume 2 delves deeper into Mark Twain\u2019s life, uncovering the many roles he played in his private and public worlds. Filled with his characteristic blend of humor and ire, the narrative ranges effortlessly across the contemporary scene. He shares his views on writing and speaking, his preoccupation with money, and his contempt for the politics and politicians of his day. Affectionate and scathing by turns, his intractable curiosity and candor are everywhere on view. Editors: Benjamin Griffin and Harriet E. Smith Associate Editors: Victor Fischer, Michael B.

In this classic autobiography, Billy Bishop vividly recreates the early days when the 'airborne jalopy' was getting its trial run. He describes the tiny Nieuport Scout, armed with a single Lewis gun, in which he had to dodge the 'Archies' (anti-aircraft batteries) and fight the scarlet tri-winged Fokkers flown by the formidable Baron von Richthofen and his squadron. The heroic memoir that portrays a real Canadian hero facing a skilled and determined enemy - Winged Warfare gets more exciting with every take off.

But it is also a terrifically engrossing exploration and exploitation of self-reflection, self-absorption, full-blown narcissism, and the impulse to write about oneself. In a world awash with memoirs and tell-alls, Shields has created something unique: he invites the reader into his mind as he turns his life into a narrative. With moving and often hilarious candor, Shields ruminates on a variety of subjects, all while exploring the impulse to confess, to use oneself as an autobiographical subject, to make one's life into a work of art. Shields explores the connections between fiction and nonfiction, stuttering and writing, literary forms and literary contents, art and life; he confronts bad reviews of his earlier books; he examines why he read a college girlfriend's journal; he raids a wide range of cultural figures (from Rousseau, Nabokov, and Salinger to Bill Murray, Adam Sandler, and Bobby Knight) for what they have to tell him about himself; he quotes a speech he wrote on the occasion of his father's ninetieth birthday and then gives us the guilt-induced dream he had when he failed to deliver the speech; he also writes about basketball and sexuality and Los Angeles and Seattle, but he is always meditating on the origins of his interest in autobiography, on the limits and appeals of autobiography, on the traps and strategies of it, and finally, how to use it to get to the world. The result is a collection of poetically charged self-reflections that reveal deep truths about ourselves as well.

But few know the private tragedies that haunted Twain, or that he was one of the fiercest advocates for progressive social causes like civil rights for African-Americans and voting rights for women. Mark Twain developed his convictions slowly, over a lifetime, very much like America itself did. Within your hands is a glimpse into the life, mind, soul, and \"truth\" of this cherished American icon. This uncensored autobiography is not only a legacy he left behind, but also a gift to all. Born Samuel Langhorne Clemens in 1835 in Florida, Missouri, Twain wrote prolifically, publishing novels, travelogues, newspaper articles, short stories, and political pamphlets. His best-known works are The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885). Written while America was still recovering from the Civil War and adjusting to the abolition of slavery, Twain's two best-known Mississippi River adventure tales also measure the depth of America's new economic and social realities. His most personal and insightful writing came when he created his, \"Final (and Right) Plan\"-a free-flowing biography of the thoughts and interests he had toward the end of his life as he spoke his \"whole frank mind\". Along with the plan, came the instruction that the enclosed autobiography writings not be published in book form until 100 years after his death. Now, 100 years after his death, we do just that, in honor of the life and writings of Mark Twain-to reacquaint ourselves with the wit, wisdom, and ideals of this legendary American icon.

The year 2010 marks the one hundredth anniversary of Twain's death. In celebration of this important milestone, here, finally, is Mark Twain's uncensored autobiography, only now free to be published in its entirety. After dozens of false starts, at last Twain embarked on his final plan for telling the story of his life. His innovative notion--to \"talk only about the thing which interests you for the moment\"--meant his thoughts could range freely. The strict instruction that many of these texts remain unpublished for one hundred years meant that when they came out, he would be \"dead, and unaware, and indifferent,\" and that he was therefore free to speak frankly. This volume presents Mark Twain's authentic and unsuppressed voice, brimming with humor, ideas, and opinions, and speaking clearly from the grave, as he intended.

William Hale White, himself an apostate from Calvinism, recounts the compelling story of a young Dissenting clergyman who loses his faith and is forced to rebuild his life in the sceptical atmosphere of London (often known in his day as `the modern Babylon'). As W. H. Massingham once remarked, `Since Bunyan, English Puritanism has produced one imaginative genius of the highest order', and White, better than any of his contemporaries recreates the lost world of the Nonconformist chapel in nineteenth-century England. This edition also includes the short story `A Mysterious Portrait', and two essays `Notes on the Book of Job' and `Principles'.

With characteristically calculated understatement, he attributed his enormous and varied successes to \"my having learnt a little to scribble.\" This collection of Franklin's works begins with letters sent from London (1757-1775) describing the events and diplomacy preceding the Revolutionary War. The volume also contains political satires, bagatelles, pamphlets, and letters written in Paris (1776-1785), where he represented the revolutionary United States at the court of Louis XVI, as well as his speeches given in the Constitutional Convention and other works written in Philadelphia (1785-1790), including his last published article, a searing satire against slavery. Also included are the delightfully shrewd prefaces to Poor Richard's Almanack (1733-1758) and their worldly, pungent maxims that have entered our American culture. Finally, the classic Autobiography, Franklin's last word on his greatest literary creation-his own invented personality-is presented here in a new edition, completely faithful to Franklin's manuscript. A companion volume includes the complete \"Silence Dogood\" series, \"Busy-Body\" essays, and a generous selection of his early writings, including letters to the press, satires, and pamphlets.

Franklin ended his life's story in 1757, when he was only fifty-one. He planned to write more-a lot more, but never did. He lived another thirty-three full, eventful, and dramatic years, some of the most dramatic years in American history, years in which Franklin was America's advocate in London, represented Pennsylvania in the Continental Congress, and was America's wartime ambassador to France. During these years Franklin also helped write our nation's Constitution and planned an American Empire that would displace the British Empire. Franklin is one of the most fascinating of the Founding Fathers-a polymath like Jefferson, a practical statesman like Washington, and a cynic and wit beyond parallel. Now, at last, in The Compleated Autobiography by Benjamin Franklin, we finally get the rest of the story, in Franklin's own words. Faithfully compiled and edited from Franklin's papers by Dr. Mark Skousen-Franklin's descendant, acting as his devoted secretary-this is the closest we will ever get to Franklin sitting down in his study in Philadelphia, dipping quill into ink, and finishing his autobiography.

Jefferson begins the work thusly, \"At the age of 77, I begin to make some memoranda and state some recollections of dates & facts concerning myself, for my own more ready reference & for the information of my family.\" While we gain some quick insight into his parents, his childhood, and the time before the revolution, much of the narrative focuses on his work on the Declaration of Independence and subsequently his political dealings in the newly formed republic. Jefferson was a man of the Enlightenment who, along with the other founding fathers, made a bold endeavor to create a new nation free from the British aristocracy. His lasting impact upon democracy cannot be overstated and \"The Autobiography of Thomas Jefferson\" is a compelling closer look into ISBN13   PageCount 115 FirstAuthor Thomas Jefferson SecondAuthor   ThirdAuthor   Rating 3.0 NumberofRatings 1 NumberofReviews 0 Publisher Digireads.com PublishDate December 14th 2009 Format Kindle Edition Language English FileName 3914-25712122-the-autobiography-of-thomas-jefferson.html   Entity 2: title Works of Thomas Jefferson, Including His Presidential Papers, Correspondence, and Autobiography Salesrank 1,171,528 authors Thomas Jefferson publication_info Publisher B&amp;R Samizdat Express ISBN13 9781455415588 PublicationDate 09/03/2011  ",

Franklin ended his life's story in 1757, when he was only fifty-one. He planned to write more-a lot more, but never did. He lived another thirty-three full, eventful, and dramatic years, some of the most dramatic years in American history, years in which Franklin was America's advocate in London, represented Pennsylvania in the Continental Congress, and was America's wartime ambassador to France. During these years Franklin also helped write our nation's Constitution and planned an American Empire that would displace the British Empire. Franklin is one of the most fascinating of the Founding Fathers-a polymath like Jefferson, a practical statesman like Washington, and a cynic and wit beyond parallel. Now, at last, in The Compleated Autobiography by Benjamin Franklin, we finally get the rest of the story, in Franklin's own words. Faithfully compiled and edited from Franklin's papers by Dr. Mark Skousen-Franklin's descendant, acting as his devoted secretary-this is the closest we will ever get to Franklin sitting down in his study in Philadelphia, dipping quill into ink, and finishing his autobiography.

This Library of America collection of Franklin's works begins with letters sent from London (1757\u20131775) describing the events and diplomacy preceding the Revolutionary War. The volume also contains political satires, bagatelles, pamphlets, and letters written in Paris (1776\u20131785), where he represented the revolutionary United States at the court of Louis XVI, as well as his speeches given in the Constitutional Convention and other works written in Philadelphia (1785\u20131790), including his last published article, a searing satire against slavery. Also included are the delightfully shrewd prefaces to Poor Richard's Almanack (1733\u20131758) and their worldly, pungent maxims that have entered our American culture. Finally, the classic Autobiography, Franklin's last word on his greatest literary creation\u2014his own invented personality\u2014is presented here in a new edition, completely faithful to Franklin's manuscript. A companion volume includes the complete \"Silence Dogood\" series, \"Busy-Body\" essays, and a generous selection of his early writings, including letters to the press, satires, and pamphlets. J. A. Leo Lemay, editor of this volume, is professor of colonial literature at the University of Delaware. The author of numerous works on Franklin, including The Canon of Benjamin Franklin 1722\u20131776: New Attributions and Reconsiderations, he has edited The Oldest Revolutionary and (with P. M.

It is at its heart one of the greatest business stories ever told. The most versatile Founding Father was a husband, a father, a writer, an inventor, a statesman, a fundraiser and a military leader. But in his mind, he was first and foremost a businessman. Franklin's captivating adventures include his almost single-handed responsibility for establishing the first media empire, the first public library, the first fire brigade, the University of Pennsylvania, the first book club and the first franchise--all of which are detailed within these pages with Franklin's characteristic mix of humility and pride. Franklin chronicles his own story, from his early days growing up in colonial Boston to his retirement from printing and growing involvement in national politics. It was during these years that he honed his management and leadership skills, acquired a fervent distaste for tyranny of all types, embraced a strong set of morals, and developed an uncompromising work ethic.

Everyone approves and everyone seems to be enjoying themselves. Until Oliver Haddo appears. Sinister and repulsive, Haddo fascinates Margaret's spinster friend, Susie Boyd. Yet it is not Susie who ultimately falls prey to his peculiar charm. It is Margaret, and a fate worse than death awaits her in the form of the evil Haddo. \"The Magician\" is one of Somerset Maugham's most complex and perceptive novels. Running through it is the theme of evil, deftly woven into a story as memorable for its action as for its astonishingly vivid characters.

Jefferson begins the work thusly, \"At the age of 77, I begin to make some memoranda and state some recollections of dates & facts concerning myself, for my own more ready reference & for the information of my family.\" While we gain some quick insight into his parents, his childhood, and the time before the revolution, much of the narrative focuses on his work on the Declaration of Independence and subsequently his political dealings in the newly formed republic. Jefferson was a man of the Enlightenment who, along with the other founding fathers, made a bold endeavor to create a new nation free from the British aristocracy.

Hebert Spencer coined the famous expression \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d. Spencer\u2019s theory inspired Andrew Carnegie and William Graham Sumner's visions of unbridled and unrepentant capitalism of the United States in late nineteenth-century. Carnegie interpreted Spencer's social theory as justifying merciless economic competition. Spencer's reputation was not recovered for many years from the interpretative caricatures of many scholars, thus marginalizing him to the hinterlands of intellectual history. Fortunately, recent scholarship has begun restoring and repairing his legacy and theory. This is a must book for readers who are interested in studying and correctly interpreting Spencer\u2019s theory that can be simply coined by him as \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d.

She attended Wellesley for two years, until her family\u2019s circumstances made it impossible for her to continue. Virginia\u2019s sister Josephine married Hugo Black; and in 1926 Virginia married a young lawyer named Clifford Durr. The Durrs moved to Washington shortly after Roosevelt\u2019s inauguration, and Clifford was one of the \u201cbright young lawyers\u201d whom the new president relied upon to draft the legislation establishing the New Deal. After World War II the Durrs moved to Denver, then to Montgomery, where Clifford became one of the few white lawyers to represent blacks in civil rights cases. During the Durrs\u2019 Washington years Virginia had been active in the movement to abolish the poll tax and in to her liberal causes; and back in Montgomery, she shared Clifford\u2019s commitment to the civil rights movement and served as an inspiration to liberals of both races. Virginia Durr has succeeded in articulating the pleasures and the difficulties of growing up female in the vigorous young city of Birmingham; the broadening (and in some ways also restricting) of young women\u2019s intellectual horizons and social life at Wellesley; and the excitement of the courtship and marriage of a proper young Southern girl of good family and poor circumstance. She brings to life the social and political climate of Washington during the New Deal and war years, where her close connection to Justice Black gave the Durrs access to people whom they might not have come to know otherwise. A victim of McCarthyism, Clifford returned with Virginia to Montgomery with no job and few prospects. Their decision to become engaged in the civil rights struggle was consistent with their lifelong commitment to follow their consciences, regardless of the social and economic consequences. \u201cVirginia Durr said it: there were three ways for a well brought-up young Southern white woman to go. She could be the actress, playing out the stereotype of the Southern belle. Gracious to \u2018the colored help,\u2019 flirtatious to her powerful father-in-law, and offering a sweet, winning smile to the world. In short, going with the wind. If she had a spark of independence or worse, creativity, she could go crazy\u2014on the dark, shadowy street traveled by more than one Southern belle. Or she could be the rebel. She could step outside the magic circle, abandon privilege, and challenge this way of life. Ostracism, bruised of all sorts, and defamation would be her lot. Her reward would be a truly examined life. And a world she would otherwise never have known.\u201d \u2014 from the Foreword by Studs Terkel ISBN 0817305173 ISBN13 9780817305178 PageCount 380 FirstAuthor Virginia Foster Durr SecondAuthor Hollinger F.

But few know the private tragedies that haunted Twain, or that he was one of the fiercest advocates for progressive social causes like civil rights for African-Americans and voting rights for women. Mark Twain developed his convictions slowly, over a lifetime, very much like America itself did. Within your hands is a glimpse into the life, mind, soul, and \"truth\" of this cherished American icon. This uncensored autobiography is not only a legacy he left behind, but also a gift to all. Born Samuel Langhorne Clemens in 1835 in Florida, Missouri, Twain wrote prolifically, publishing novels, travelogues, newspaper articles, short stories, and political pamphlets. His best-known works are The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885). Written while America was still recovering from the Civil War and adjusting to the abolition of slavery, Twain's two best-known Mississippi River adventure tales also measure the depth of America's new economic and social realities. His most personal and insightful writing came when he created his, \"Final (and Right) Plan\"-a free-flowing biography of the thoughts and interests he had toward the end of his life as he spoke his \"whole frank mind\". Along with the plan, came the instruction that the enclosed autobiography writings not be published in book form until 100 years after his death. Now, 100 years after his death, we do just that, in honor of the life and writings of Mark Twain-to reacquaint ourselves with the wit, wisdom, and ideals of this legendary American icon.

In this intimate, charming autobiography, he shares his stories and the lessons he\u2019s learned about quiet leadership.He describes how on D-Day he commanded one of the landing crafts at Omaha Beach, and witnessed one of the greatest battles in American military history. Later, in his role as co-chair of Goldman Sachs, he was one of the pioneers of the globalization of international finance that was to change the face of American business. In 1985, Whitehead was appointed Deputy Secretary of State under President Ronald Reagan and became the architect of the Reagan administration\u2019s successful efforts to wean the countries of Eastern Europe from the Soviet Union and to open up space there for the democratic movements that eventually resulted in the fall of the Berlin Wall.Most recently, he was appointed by New York Governor George Pataki as Chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which is charged with the task of rebuilding Ground Zero. Whitehead provides a first-hand account of the difficult decisions the LMDC has made in meeting its goals of re-developing lower Manhattan and honoring the victims of 9/11 as the capstone of his remarkable career.

A leader of the Republican and Progressive Parties, he was a Governor of New York and a professional historian, naturalist, explorer, hunter, author, and soldier. He was a Progressive reformer who sought to move the dominant Republican Party into the Progressive camp. He distrusted wealthy businessmen and dissolved forty monopolistic corporations. Roosevelt was a great personality, a great activist, a great preacher of the moralities, a great controversialist, a great showman, and he dominated his era.

These three autobiographies take you through much of the life and times of Roosevelt.

Historically, Native American autobiographers have written in the shadow of Indian law, a nuanced form of natural law discourse with its own set of related institutions and forms (the reservation, the treaty, etc.). In Sovereign Selves, David J. Carlson develops a rigorously historicized argument about the relationship between the specific colonial model of Indian identity that was developed and disseminated through U.S. legal institutions, and the acts of autobiographical self-definition by the colonized Indians expected to fit that model.

The year 2010 marks the one hundredth anniversary of Twain's death. In celebration of this important milestone, here, finally, is Mark Twain's uncensored autobiography, only now free to be published in its entirety. After dozens of false starts, at last Twain embarked on his final plan for telling the story of his life. His innovative notion--to \"talk only about the thing which interests you for the moment\"--meant his thoughts could range freely. The strict instruction that many of these texts remain unpublished for one hundred years meant that when they came out, he would be \"dead, and unaware, and indifferent,\" and that he was therefore free to speak frankly. This volume presents Mark Twain's authentic and unsuppressed voice, brimming with humor, ideas, and opinions, and speaking clearly from the grave, as he intended.

Franklin ended his life's story in 1757, when he was only fifty-one. He planned to write more-a lot more, but never did. He lived another thirty-three full, eventful, and dramatic years, some of the most dramatic years in American history, years in which Franklin was America's advocate in London, represented Pennsylvania in the Continental Congress, and was America's wartime ambassador to France. During these years Franklin also helped write our nation's Constitution and planned an American Empire that would displace the British Empire. Franklin is one of the most fascinating of the Founding Fathers-a polymath like Jefferson, a practical statesman like Washington, and a cynic and wit beyond parallel. Now, at last, in The Compleated Autobiography by Benjamin Franklin, we finally get the rest of the story, in Franklin's own words. Faithfully compiled and edited from Franklin's papers by Dr. Mark Skousen-Franklin's descendant, acting as his devoted secretary-this is the closest we will ever get to Franklin sitting down in his study in Philadelphia, dipping quill into ink, and finishing his autobiography.

St. Teresa wrote this memoir at the behest of her confessor. It offers a warm, accessible account of her transformation into an impassioned leader and reformer of church doctrine. St. Teresa recounts her childhood and education in sixteenth-century Spain, her physical afflictions and spiritual crises, her many visions and mystical encounters, and her determination to embrace the contemplative life. In describing the ascent of the soul, she explains the core of her theology as a four-stage process that progresses from mental prayer to divine rapture. Next to Don Quixote, this timeless work constitutes Spain's most popular prose classic. It forms an excellent introduction to the saint's other writings and to the Christian tradition of mystical literature.

Here he tells his story in his own way, freely expressing his joys and sorrows, his affections and hatreds, his rages and reverence\u2014ending, as always, tongue-in-cheek: \u201cNow, then, that is the tale. Some of it is true.\u201d More than the story of a literary career, this memoir is anchored in the writer\u2019s relation to his family\u2014what they meant to him as a husband, father, and artist. It also brims with many of Twain\u2019s best comic anecdotes about his rambunctious boyhood in Hannibal, his misadventures in the Nevada territory, his notorious Whittier birthday speech, his travels abroad, and more. Twain published twenty-five \u201cChapters from My Autobiography\u201d in the North American Review in 1906 and 1907. \u201cI intend that this autobiography . . . shall be read and admired a good many centuries because of its form and method\u2014form and method whereby the past and the present are constantly brought face to face, resulting in contrasts which newly fire up the interest all along, like contact of flint with steel.\u201d For this second edition, Michael Kiskis\u2019s introduction references a wealth of critical work done on Twain since 1990. He also adds a discussion of literary domesticity, locating the autobiography within the history of Twain\u2019s literary work and within Twain\u2019s own understanding and experience of domestic concerns.

When the first volume of Mark Twain\u2019s uncensored Autobiography was published in 2010, it was hailed as an essential addition to the shelf of his works and a crucial document for our understanding of the great humorist\u2019s life and times. This third and final volume crowns and completes his life\u2019s work. Like its companion volumes, it chronicles Twain's inner and outer life through a series of daily dictations that go wherever his fancy leads. Created from March 1907 to December 1909, these dictations present Mark Twain at the end of his life: receiving an honorary degree from Oxford University; railing against Theodore Roosevelt; founding numerous clubs; incredulous at an exhibition of the Holy Grail; credulous about the authorship of Shakespeare\u2019s plays; relaxing in Bermuda; observing (and investing in) new technologies. The Autobiography \u2019s \u201cClosing Words\u201d movingly commemorate his daughter Jean, who died on Christmas Eve 1909. Also included in this volume is the previously unpublished \u201cAshcroft-Lyon Manuscript,\u201d Mark Twain\u2019s caustic indictment of his \u201cputrescent pair\u201d of secretaries and the havoc that erupted in his house during their residency. Fitfully published in fragments at intervals throughout the twentieth century, Autobiography of Mark Twain has now been critically reconstructed and made available as it was intended to be read. Fully annotated by the editors of the Mark Twain Project, the complete Autobiography emerges as a landmark publication in American literature.

It is at its heart one of the greatest business stories ever told. The most versatile Founding Father was a husband, a father, a writer, an inventor, a statesman, a fundraiser and a military leader. But in his mind, he was first and foremost a businessman. Franklin's captivating adventures include his almost single-handed responsibility for establishing the first media empire, the first public library, the first fire brigade, the University of Pennsylvania, the first book club and the first franchise--all of which are detailed within these pages with Franklin's characteristic mix of humility and pride. Franklin chronicles his own story, from his early days growing up in colonial Boston to his retirement from printing and growing involvement in national politics. It was during these years that he honed his management and leadership skills, acquired a fervent distaste for tyranny of all types, embraced a strong set of morals, and developed an uncompromising work ethic. From the moment he fled his tyrannical master and set himself up as a printer in Philadelphia, all who came into contact with Franklin recognized his destiny. His wisdom transcends the ages--and his life lessons are insights are as compelling today as ever.

The author's life was one of struggle. She fought against the tyranny of her mother in the home and an arranged marriage, against the warlords in the fields, and against the Kuomintang when they split with the Communists. Above all she fought against the Chinese traditions of valuing boys far above girls, and of consigning unmarried women to limbo. The romantic idealism of the revolution in its early days, the iniquities of the old family system it overthrew, the passionate friendships of the young girl soldiers, and the personal sacrifices involved in creating the new order are brought vividly to life in this touching and thought-provoking book. Written in the 'new realism' style of the period, this is an important work of its time and place, and a significant contribution to women's writing and history generally. The volume begins with a detailed account of the development of early revolutionary Chinese politics and literature.

He would not allow the book to be published until after his death, so that he could speak freely, as in a love letter. In the manner in which Twain is so well-known, his autobiography is really not an autobiography at all, but a series of entertaining stories and opinions, dinner table talks, such as he had always delivered in his own home and elsewhere, and with about the same latitude and elaboration. Twain's narrative is not in any sense a mere fairy tale, many of the chapters, especially the earlier ones, are vividly true in their presentation. The things he told of Mrs. Clemens and Susy are marvelously and beautifully true in spirit and aspect, and the story as a whole is amazingly faithful in the character picture it presents of the man himself.

Holmes Description Autobiography of the KING of PORN In the world of adult cinema, one name stands out above all others: John Holmes. For nearly 20 years, from 1967 to 1987, Holmes reigned as the undisputed King of X-rated films, having appeared in a record 2,200 plus productions, from the landmark Johnny Wadd movies (one of which became the first adult motion picture to gross over $1 million) to the legendary Insatiable with Marilyn Chambers. To a legion of fans World-wide, he was known as \u201cMr. Big.\u201d To industry insiders, he was \u201cMr. Nice Guy.\u201d Yet for all of his fame and notoriety, Holmes remained an intensely private person and a mystery man. That is, until now. In a startlingly frank autobiography, PORN KING was written in large part prior to his death (with new material added by his widow, Laurie,) Holmes tells the story of his incredible life. This is not a typical celebrity story, filled with bright lights and glamour, giant sound stages and movie moguls. It is, instead, a rare portrait of a young man drawn into an unknown Hollywood, a secret, forbidden Hollywood, and the parallels between his astounding career and the sexual revolution in American films. Holmes knew his subject better than anyone. Holmes candidly tells of a lucrative but often harrowing \u201cother\u201d life as a male prostitute to the rich and famous, a shattering fall into drugs and his side of the grisly Wonderland Murders and his desperate cross-country flight afterwards. From start to finish, in this newly revised edition, complete with never-before-seen candid photos of Holmes in his private life, PORN KING is a sizzling, sensuous, fast-paced story laced with controversy.

The author is Black Hawk himself - once pursued by an army whose members included Captain Abraham Lincoln and Lieutenant Jefferson Davis. Perhaps no Indian ever saw so much of American expansion or fought harder to prevent that expansion from driving his people to exile and death. He knew Zebulon Pike, William Clark, Henry Schoolcraft, George Catlin, Winfield Scott, and such figures in American government as President Andrew Jackson and Secretary of State Lewis Cass. He knew Chicago when it was a cluster of log houses around a fort, and he was in St. Louis the day the American flag went up and the French flag came down. He saw crowds gather to cheer him in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New York - and to stone the driver of his carriage in Albany - during a fantastic tour sponsored by the government. And at last he dies in 1838, bitter in the knowledge that he had led men, women, and children of his tribe to slaughter on the banks of the Mississippi. After his capture at the end of the Black Hawk War, he was imprisoned for a time and then released to live in the territory that is now Iowa. He dictated his autobiography to a government interpreter, Antoine LeClaire, and the story was put into written form by J. B. Patterson, a young Illinois newspaperman. Since its first appearance in 1833, the autobiography has become known as an American classic.

Hebert Spencer coined the famous expression \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d. Spencer\u2019s theory inspired Andrew Carnegie and William Graham Sumner's visions of unbridled and unrepentant capitalism of the United States in late nineteenth-century. Carnegie interpreted Spencer's social theory as justifying merciless economic competition. Spencer's reputation was not recovered for many years from the interpretative caricatures of many scholars, thus marginalizing him to the hinterlands of intellectual history. Fortunately, recent scholarship has begun restoring and repairing his legacy and theory. This is a must book for readers who are interested in studying and correctly interpreting Spencer\u2019s theory that can be simply coined by him as \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d.

Dick Francis, now one of the world's outstanding thriller writers, made his first career as a steeplechase jockey after serving in the RAF during the war. The height of his riding achievements was as Champion Jockey; the lowest point was when his mount Devon Loch, owned by the Queen Mother, sprawled just before the winning post in the 1956 Grand National. However, this traumatic event led, a few months later, to Dick being asked to write his autobiography. Having completed The Sport of Queens, Dick decided that the writing game was a good substitute for the racing game.

But few know the private tragedies that haunted Twain, or that he was one of the fiercest advocates for progressive social causes like civil rights for African-Americans and voting rights for women. Mark Twain developed his convictions slowly, over a lifetime, very much like America itself did. Within your hands is a glimpse into the life, mind, soul, and \"truth\" of this cherished American icon. This uncensored autobiography is not only a legacy he left behind, but also a gift to all. Born Samuel Langhorne Clemens in 1835 in Florida, Missouri, Twain wrote prolifically, publishing novels, travelogues, newspaper articles, short stories, and political pamphlets. His best-known works are The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885). Written while America was still recovering from the Civil War and adjusting to the abolition of slavery, Twain's two best-known Mississippi River adventure tales also measure the depth of America's new economic and social realities. His most personal and insightful writing came when he created his, \"Final (and Right) Plan\"-a free-flowing biography of the thoughts and interests he had toward the end of his life as he spoke his \"whole frank mind\". Along with the plan, came the instruction that the enclosed autobiography writings not be published in book form until 100 years after his death. Now, 100 years after his death, we do just that, in honor of the life and writings of Mark Twain-to reacquaint ourselves with the wit, wisdom, and ideals of this legendary American icon.

After that seedtime came the years of exile during which - he was a 'listed' person - none of his works could be read in South Africa. His second autobiography, Afrika My Music, is set amidst the tumultuous years of his return to South Africa after 1976. 'Bantu Education' - the system which had forced him out of teaching and into exile when it was introduced in the Fifties - had triggered the Soweto revolt barely a month before he returned to his native land after twenty years in Europe, Africa and the United States. Drawing strength from ancestral ground, he begins to grapple with old cultural dilemmas that haven't gone away and new ones that plague an age of pseudo-reform. Meanwhile he unpacks his traveller's trunk of memories. African writers, artists, musicians, educationists and politicians crowd his pages, in settings ranging from Ibadan through Paris to Philadelphia. Friendships and conversations with the living and the dead, university teaching, work as an organiser of arts programmes in Africa - against this backdrop the mature views of Mphahlele the African Humanist come into focus. We begin to understand his controversial decision to return, and what it was he came back to do.

'The Autobiography of Theodore Roosevelt' is an invaluable literary work and a true gift to readers, as it is a glimpse into the psyche of such an enigmatic historical figure. Roosevelt led a life rich in accomplishments not limited to his being the youngest president in US history. He was a courageous soldier, posthumously receiving the Medal of Honor for his creation and leadership of the Rough Riders in Cuba during the Spanish-American War. He was also the first American to win a Nobel Peace prize, which he received for his negotiation of the end of the Russo-Japanese War. In addition, Roosevelt was an adventurer with a taste for hunting and exploring, especially in South America, where a river is named after him. His iconic slogan, \"Speak softly and carry a big stick,\" is still quoted and embodied by politicians to this very day, exemplifying his indelible impact on the history of the United States. http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=s...

With characteristically calculated understatement, he attributed his enormous and varied successes to \"my having learnt a little to scribble.\" This collection of Franklin's works begins with letters sent from London (1757-1775) describing the events and diplomacy preceding the Revolutionary War. The volume also contains political satires, bagatelles, pamphlets, and letters written in Paris (1776-1785), where he represented the revolutionary United States at the court of Louis XVI, as well as his speeches given in the Constitutional Convention and other works written in Philadelphia (1785-1790), including his last published article, a searing satire against slavery. Also included are the delightfully shrewd prefaces to Poor Richard's Almanack (1733-1758) and their worldly, pungent maxims that have entered our American culture. Finally, the classic Autobiography, Franklin's last word on his greatest literary creation-his own invented personality-is presented here in a new edition, completely faithful to Franklin's manuscript. A companion volume includes the complete \"Silence Dogood\" series, \"Busy-Body\" essays, and a generous selection of his early writings, including letters to the press, satires, and pamphlets.

Here he tells his story in his own way, freely expressing his joys and sorrows, his affections and hatreds, his rages and reverence\u2014ending, as always, tongue-in-cheek: \u201cNow, then, that is the tale. Some of it is true.\u201d More than the story of a literary career, this memoir is anchored in the writer\u2019s relation to his family\u2014what they meant to him as a husband, father, and artist. It also brims with many of Twain\u2019s best comic anecdotes about his rambunctious boyhood in Hannibal, his misadventures in the Nevada territory, his notorious Whittier birthday speech, his travels abroad, and more. Twain published twenty-five \u201cChapters from My Autobiography\u201d in the North American Review in 1906 and 1907. \u201cI intend that this autobiography . . . shall be read and admired a good many centuries because of its form and method\u2014form and method whereby the past and the present are constantly brought face to face, resulting in contrasts which newly fire up the interest all along, like contact of flint with steel.\u201d For this second edition, Michael Kiskis\u2019s introduction references a wealth of critical work done on Twain since 1990. He also adds a discussion of literary domesticity, locating the autobiography within the history of Twain\u2019s literary work and within Twain\u2019s own understanding and experience of domestic concerns.

A True History of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson (1682), perhaps the first American bestseller, recounts this thirty-nine-year-old woman\u2019s harrowing months as the captive of Narragansett Indians. The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin (1771\u20131789), the most famous of all American autobiographies, gives a lively portrait of a chandler\u2019s son who became a scientist, inventor, educator, diplomat, humorist\u2014and a Founding Father of this land. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass (1845), the gripping slave narrative that helped change the course of American history, reveals the true nature of the black experience in slavery. Old Times on the Mississippi (1875), Mark Twain\u2019s unforgettable account of a riverboat pilot\u2019s life, established his signature style and shows us the metamorphosis of a man into a writer. Four Autobiographical Narratives (1900\u20131902), published in the Atlantic Monthly by Zitkala-Sa (Red Bird), also known as Gertrude Bonnin, provide us with a voice too seldom heard: a Native American woman fighting for her culture in the white man\u2019s world.

With characteristically calculated understatement, he attributed his enormous and varied successes to \"my having learnt a little to scribble.\" This collection of Franklin's works begins with letters sent from London (1757-1775) describing the events and diplomacy preceding the Revolutionary War. The volume also contains political satires, bagatelles, pamphlets, and letters written in Paris (1776-1785), where he represented the revolutionary United States at the court of Louis XVI, as well as his speeches given in the Constitutional Convention and other works written in Philadelphia (1785-1790), including his last published article, a searing satire against slavery. Also included are the delightfully shrewd prefaces to Poor Richard's Almanack (1733-1758) and their worldly, pungent maxims that have entered our American culture. Finally, the classic Autobiography, Franklin's last word on his greatest literary creation-his own invented personality-is presented here in a new edition, completely faithful to Franklin's manuscript.

Another prominent trait in Spohr\u2019s character was his childlike simplicity, combined with never-failing good-nature and an inability to bear malice. Nor did the many unavoidable trials and vexations of a long life ever permanently disturb his good humour or sour his temper; and even gross injustice failed to do more than temporarily ruffle the calm serenity of his soul. Thus he passed through the world, an active and highly useful member of society, beloved and respected by all who knew him, till in process of time he went down to his grave full of years and honour. As is explained in the text, the Autobiography comes to an end with the month of June 1838; but the description of the life and doings of the great master from that date till the time of his death was continued from reliable materials furnished by Mrs. Spohr and other members of the family; so that the whole forms a true account and lively picture of Spohr\u2019s earthly career from his cradle to his grave.\" ISBN13   PageCount 0 FirstAuthor Louis Spohr SecondAuthor   ThirdAuthor   Rating 3.0 NumberofRatings 1 NumberofReviews 1 Publisher Project Gutenberg PublishDate June 16th 2014 Format ebook Language English FileName 3872-22697424-louis-spohr-autobiography.html   Entity 2: title Louis Spohr's autobiography : translated from the German authors Louis Spohr publication_info Publisher London : Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts, &amp; Green ISBN13 2940021452618  ",

He studied at the University of Pennsylvania, and received the degree of M. D. at Jefferson Medical College in 1850. His medical texts include Injuries of Nerves and Their Consequences (1872) and Fat and Blood (1877). In 1863 he wrote a clever short story, combining physiological and psychological problems, entitled The Case of George Dedlow, in the Atlantic Monthly Magazine. Thenceforward Dr Weir Mitchell, as a writer, divided his attention between professional and literary pursuits. His historical novels, Hugh Wynne, Free Quaker (1897), The Adventures of Fran\u00e7ois (1898) and The Red City (1909), take high rank in this branch of fiction. He was also Charlotte Perkins Gilman's doctor and his use of a rest cure on her provided the idea for The Yellow Wallpaper, a short story in which the narrator is driven insane by her rest cure.

The year 2010 marks the one hundredth anniversary of Twain's death. In celebration of this important milestone, here, finally, is Mark Twain's uncensored autobiography, only now free to be published in its entirety. After dozens of false starts, at last Twain embarked on his final plan for telling the story of his life. His innovative notion--to \"talk only about the thing which interests you for the moment\"--meant his thoughts could range freely. The strict instruction that many of these texts remain unpublished for one hundred years meant that when they came out, he would be \"dead, and unaware, and indifferent,\" and that he was therefore free to speak frankly. This volume presents Mark Twain's authentic and unsuppressed voice, brimming with humor, ideas, and opinions, and speaking clearly from the grave, as he intended.

        "input": "Entity 1: ID 1321 Title Postcolonial Theory and Autobiography Description Cultural theory has often been criticized for covert Eurocentric and universalist tendencies. Its concepts and ideas are implicitly applicable to everyone, ironing over any individuality or cultural difference. Postcolonial theory has challenged these limitations of cultural theory, and Postcolonial Theory and Autobiography addresses the central challenge posed by its autobiographical turn. Despite the fact that autobiography is frequently dismissed for its Western, masculine bias, David Huddart argues for its continued relevance as a central explanatory category in understanding postcolonial theory and its relation to subjectivity. Focusing on the influence of post-structuralist theory on postcolonial theory and vice versa, this study suggests that autobiography constitutes a general philosophical resistance to universal concepts and theories. Offering a fresh perspective on familiar critical figures like Edward W. Said and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, by putting them in the context of readings of the work of Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, and Alain Badiou, this book relates the theory of autobiography to expressions of new universalisms that, together with postcolonial theory, rethink and extend norms of experience, investigation, and knowledge.

Labor organizer Mother Jones worked tirelessly for economic justice. Mary Harris \"Mother\" Jones (1837\u20131930) was an Irish-American schoolteacher and dressmaker who became a prominent labor and community organizer. She then helped coordinate major strikes and cofounded the Industrial Workers of the World. While her opponents called her the \u201cmost dangerous woman in America,\u201d fellow organizer Elizabeth Gurley Flynn called Jones \u201cthe greatest woman agitator of our times.\u201d Jones combined dynamic speaking skills and radical organizing methods to mobilize thousands of laborers and working-class families. She said of herself, \u201cI\u2019m not a humanitarian, I\u2019m a hell-raiser.\u201d Mary Harris Jones was born approximately August 1, 1837 in Cork, Ireland to Helen Cotter and Richard Harris. She had two brothers and two sisters. Jones later claimed a birthdate of May 1, 1830. Biographers suggest that she chose 1830 to add to the image of white-haired \u201cMother\u201d Jones, and May first to connect herself to the Haymarket demonstration for the eight-hour day. Mary\u2019s father moved to the United States in the 1840s, and the rest of the family followed soon thereafter.

He went on to attain success as a songwriter on Broadway and as the compiler of the definitive Book of American Negro Spirituals . But he achieved one of his greatest triumphs in 1912, when, under a pseudonym, he published The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man \u2014a classic novel about a musician who rejects his black roots, a novel that is still in print today in multiple paperback editions. Johnson went on to be, from 1920 to 1930, the first African-American head of the NAACP, fighting tirelessly for the passage of a federal anti-lynching law. His life story is that of a truly remarkable man who triumphed over a system of institutionalized racism to become one of black America\u2019s leading educators, men of letters, and reformers.

This is The Complete Works of America\u2019s favourite storyteller Mark Twain. The eBook contains over 60 novels and shorter texts (short stories, essays, letters, speeches). Twain began his career writing light, humorous verse, but evolved into a chronicler of the vanities, hypocrisies and murderous acts of mankind. At mid-career, with Huckleberry Finn, he combined rich humor, sturdy narrative and social criticism. Twain was a master at rendering colloquial speech and helped to create and popularize a distinctive American literature built on American themes and language. Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835 \u2013 1910), better known by his pen name Mark Twain, was an American author and humorist. He wrote The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and its sequel, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), the latter often called \"the Great American Novel.\" ISBN13   PageCount 0 FirstAuthor Mark Twain SecondAuthor   ThirdAuthor   Rating 4.53 NumberofRatings 129 NumberofReviews 4 Publisher e-artnow PublishDate February 27th 2014 Format Kindle Edition Language English FileName 1360-21461029-the-complete-works-of-mark-twain.html   Entity 2: title Autobiography of Mark Twain: Volume 1, Reader's Edition Pages 440 Salesrank 226,836 ratings Ratingscount 737 Ratingvalue 3.3  prices Paperbackprice $19.42 Hardcoverprice $30.19 Nookbookprice $18.81  authors Mark Twain publication_info Publisher University of California Press ISBN13 9780520952447 PublicationDate 03/26/2012  ",

She was a reformer of the Carmelite Order and is considered to be a founder of the Discalced Carmelites along with John of the Cross. In 1622, forty years after her death, she was canonized by Pope Gregory XV and was in 1970 named a Doctor of the Church by Pope Paul VI. Her books, which include her autobiography (The Life of Teresa of Jesus) and her seminal work El Castillo Interior (The Interior Castle) are an integral part of Spanish Renaissance literature as well as Christian mysticism and Christian meditation practices as she entails in her other important work, Camino de Perfeccion (The Way of Perfection). Readers interested in basic Christian mysticism need look no further than Saint Teresa of Avila. Theresa expresses in beautiful language her deep relationship with God, and her words of wisdom and ever-hopeful outlook have inspired Christians everywhere for centuries. The Spanish Carmelite nun's autobiography provides a perfect entrance point to the world of mental prayer. She begins her story with tales of her childhood in the early 1500s--the death of her mother, how she became a nun, and the hardships of her life including illness and a period of \"lukewarmness\" during which she ceased to pray. St. Teresa also relates the visiosn and instructions she recieved form God later in her life. This book also contains St. Teresa's writings on the four states of mental prayer. In the first stage, believers learn to pray. In the second, they experience the supernatural aspect of prayer. In the third, the soul is bathed inthe pleasure of God's presence, and in the fourth, senses are abandonded in a sort of out-of-body experience where the sould feels only divine union. This book also contains a series of \"relations,\" letters she send to colleagues giving further thoughts of her beliefs. St. Teresa's warm and personal descriptions of union with God provide a wonderful and accessible starting point for engagement in her life and theology of mysticism.

She married Herbert Henry Asquith, who would become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1908-1916). During World War I, Asquith's outspokenness led to a public outcry. For example, she visited a German prisoner of war camp and she accused her shell-shocked stepson Herbert of being drunk. The negative public and media response may well have contributed to the political downfall of her husband. After her husband's death, she was left in near penury and, though she made some money as a writer of numerous autobiographies, her financial position caused her constant concern. Her writing style was not always critically accepted-the most famous review of Asquith's work came from New York wit Dorothy Parker, who wrote, \"The affair between Margot Asquith and Margot Asquith will live as one of the prettiest love stories in all literature. \" ISBN 1409974995 ISBN13 9781409974994 PageCount 324 FirstAuthor Margot Asquith SecondAuthor   ThirdAuthor   Rating 3.15 NumberofRatings 13 NumberofReviews 2 Publisher Dodo Press PublishDate April 1st 2009 Format Paperback Language English FileName 464-14295314-an-autobiography.html   Entity 2: title The autobiography of Margot Asquith authors Margot Asquith Oxford and Asquith publication_info Publisher London : Butterworth ISBN13 2940019401550  ",

Hebert Spencer coined the famous expression \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d. Spencer\u2019s theory inspired Andrew Carnegie and William Graham Sumner's visions of unbridled and unrepentant capitalism of the United States in late nineteenth-century. Carnegie interpreted Spencer's social theory as justifying merciless economic competition. Spencer's reputation was not recovered for many years from the interpretative caricatures of many scholars, thus marginalizing him to the hinterlands of intellectual history. Fortunately, recent scholarship has begun restoring and repairing his legacy and theory. This is a must book for readers who are interested in studying and correctly interpreting Spencer\u2019s theory that can be simply coined by him as \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d.

        "input": "Entity 1: ID 1324 Title Autobiography of Mark Twain: Ruminations on His Life and Times, in His Own Words, Volume 1 Description John Hay once told Mark Twain that when a man has reached forty years old, he has already done whatever was worth doing in his life and should start writing his autobiography; invariably, whether trying to be truthful or intentionally inventing fictions, the real truth of the man's life will be apparent to the reader. He went on to say that \"there is a subtle devilish something or other about autobiographical composition that defeats all the writer's attempts to paint his portrait his way.\" With this in mind, Mark Twain began writing his autobiography, at the age of forty-two. He struggled with what to write about and in what order, frequently abandoning the project and returning to it every few years before finally hitting upon on the best way to write an autobiography: \"Start it at no particular time of your life; wander at your free will all over your life; talk only about the thing which interests you for the moment; drop it the moment its interest threatens to pale, and turn your talk upon the new and more interesting thing that has intruded itself into your mind meantime.\" This volume collects a number of Twain's autobiographical writings, collected from a variety of manuscripts, articles and dictations dated between 1870 and 1906. A true treasure for the fan of Mark Twain and American history and literature, the events described and the ruminations of America's greatest wit give a rare glimpse into another time and a gifted mind. Even though more than one hundred years have passed since Twain's thoughts and observations have been put to paper, they remain just as clever, humorous and insightful in modern times. This edition has been carefully produced with the reader in mind. The texts have been meticulously proofread and formatted with the Kindle screen in mind to create an optimum reading experience. As a bonus, photos of Mark Twain and his family have been included as well as a brief overview of Twain's life and legacy. There is no doubt that this edition will be an absolute pleasure to read for the Twain fan and casual reader alike.

The year 2010 marks the one hundredth anniversary of Twain's death. In celebration of this important milestone, here, finally, is Mark Twain's uncensored autobiography, only now free to be published in its entirety. After dozens of false starts, at last Twain embarked on his final plan for telling the story of his life. His innovative notion--to \"talk only about the thing which interests you for the moment\"--meant his thoughts could range freely. The strict instruction that many of these texts remain unpublished for one hundred years meant that when they came out, he would be \"dead, and unaware, and indifferent,\" and that he was therefore free to speak frankly. This volume presents Mark Twain's authentic and unsuppressed voice, brimming with humor, ideas, and opinions, and speaking clearly from the grave, as he intended.

In his short life (1876\u20131916) he wrote twenty-five novels and dozens of short stories, plays, and essays. Today he is recognized as a forerunner of such literary giants as Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck, and Jack Kerouac. Author of a number of well-known and well-loved stories in our literature (including White Fang, The Call of the Wild , and The Sea Wolf ), London also worked as a day laborer, Alaskan gold rusher, and seaman. He was also an adventurer, journalist, celebrity, polemicist, and drunk. An Autobiography of Jack London is a revealing portrait of the man who was Jack London\u2014in his own words\u2014and is largely composed of excerpts from his memoirs: The Road, John Barleycorn , and The Cruise of the Snark . Rather than a mere biographical summary of a man\u2019s life, An Autobiography of Jack London aims to give the reader real insight into the character and personality of this uniquely American literary icon. This book is illustrated throughout with more than forty drawings, facsimile pages from his works, and contemporary photographs, many taken by London himself.

Auden, Miles Davis, Andy Warhol. Born Larry Grossberg in 1923 in the Bronx, NY, Rivers began his career in 1940 as a jazz saxophonist and composer, changed his name and became an American icon to artists everywhere. A great figurative painter, Rivers is also acclaimed as a precursor of pop art; an artist with an unashamed interest in sexuality and the private moment, he is also celebrated for bringing history back into contemporary painting. Candid, thoughtful, and funny, this book is among the finest of artists' memoirs. This edition includes 16 pages of color and 130 black-and-white illustrations. \"What Did I Do? is the harrowingly true tale of a man whose early years were, by his own accounting, governed by often brutal instincts. He responds crazily, rashly to jazz and sex and drugs, and finally to paint, becoming Larry Rivers, one of the most humane and interesting and idiosyncratic visual artists of our time.\"\u2014Kurt Vonnegut ISBN 1560253193 ISBN13 9781560253198 PageCount 512 FirstAuthor Larry Rivers SecondAuthor Arnold Weinstein ThirdAuthor   Rating 4.02 NumberofRatings 46 NumberofReviews 7 Publisher Da Capo Press PublishDate June 12th 2001 Format Paperback Language English FileName 1361-379297.What_Did_I_Do_.html   Entity 2: title What Did I Do?: The Unauthorized Autobiography of Larry Rivers Pages 498 authors Larry Rivers Arnold Weinstein publication_info Publisher HarperCollins Publishers ISBN13 9780060190071 PublicationDate 10/01/1992  ",

After a miserable childhood and misspent youth, Trollope turned his life around at the age of twenty-six. By 1860 the 'hobbledehoy' had become both a senior civil servant and a best-selling novelist. He worked for the Post Office for many years and stood unsuccessfully for Parliament. Best-known for the two series of novels grouped loosely around the clerical and political professions, the Barsetshire and Palliser series, in his Autobiography Trollope frankly describes his writing habits. His apparent preoccupation with contracts, deadlines, and earnings, and his account of the remorseless regularity with which he produced his daily quota of words, has divided opinion ever since. As the Introduction to this edition shows, Trollope selected and exaggerated to create his compelling narrative of initial failure and eventual success, and the inspiration that fuelled his creative imagination has too easily been overlooked. The only autobiography by a major Victorian novelist, Trollope's record offers a fascinating insight into his literary life and opinions. This edition also includes a selection of his critical writings to show how subtle and complex his approach to literature really was.

Autobiographies is his most surprising achievement to date. It opens with a group of lyric and reflective poems remarkable for their formal control and depth of feeling. There is, for example, a harrowing poem about Dracula told from the viewpoint of a young woman subject to his spell. The poems \"Coventry\" and \"Cannot Be a Tourist\" enact moments of recognition in other countries. The narrator's experience of being on his own in New York City after the end of a thirteen-year relationship is explored in \"Resolutions\" and \"La Madeleine,\" the latter following parallels in the life of Mary Magdalene and Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. \"Contemporary Culture and the Letter K\" charts twentieth-century experience up to the age of AIDS according to the fortunes of a single letter of the alphabet. The volume's long poem, \"1992,\" is an autobiographical narrative set in many different locations in the United States, with scenes from five decades of the author's life. These are placed beside brief, plangent narratives from imagined lives of a wide cast of characters: a Puerto Rican teenager living in New York, a young woman of the Havasupai tribe, a retired black artist in northern Ohio, a Wisconsin mother visiting a dying relative, a young man serving time for disorderly conduct in a New Hampshire jail. The cumulatively widening and deepening picture of autobiographical and imagined experience provides a vivid and varied account of late twentieth-century America up to the quincentennial year of Columbus's voyage. In decades to come, Autobiographies will be remembered as a bold and innovative turning point in this author's achievement.

It was a bowdlerized edition: Darwin's family, attempting to protect his posthumous reputation, had deleted all the passages they considered too personal or controversial. The present complete edition did not appear until 1959, one hundred years after the publication of The Origin of Species . Upon its appearance, Loren Eiseley wrote: \"No man can pretend to know Darwin who does not know his autobiography. Here, for the first time since his death, it is presented complete and unexpurgated, as it exists in the family archives. It will prove invaluable to biographers and cast new light on the personality of one of the world's greatest scientists. Nora Barlow, Darwin's granddaughter, has proved herself a superb editor. Her own annotations make fascinating reading.\" The daring and restless mind, the integrity and simplicity of Darwin's character are revealed in this direct and personal account of his life\u2014his family, his education, his explorations of the natural world, his religion and philosophy. The editor has provided page and line references to the more important restored passages, and previously unpublished notes and letters on family matters and on the controversy between Samuel Butler appear in an appendix.

Dr. Hamilton, in whose name AIHA recently established an annual achievement award, was a leading authority on lead poisoning and other industrial hygiene concerns years before AIHA was even formed. But this book is more than just a narrative of her accomplishments in ocupational medicine; it provides insight into her personality, her humor, her beliefs and, most important, her determination to make the world a better place.

This volume brings together the key chapters of his most important and accessible books, including the Journal of Researches on the Beagle voyage (1845), The Origin of Species (1859), and The Descent of Man (1871), along with the full text of his delightful autobiography. They are accompanied by generous selections of responses from Darwin's nineteenth-century readers from across the world. More than anything, they give a keen sense of the controversial nature of Darwin's ideas, and his position within Victorian debates about man's place in nature. The wide-ranging Introduction by James A. Secord, Director of the Darwin Correspondence Project, explores the global impact and origins of Darwin's work and the reasons for its unparalleled significance today. To increase its usefulness for readers coming to Darwin for the first time, the selection also includes a map of the Beagle voyage, a detailed chronology of Darwin's life, and a biographical appendix identifying every individual mentioned in the text.

        "input": "Entity 1: ID 1066 Title As If: An Autobiography Description As If: An Autobiography traces the complex life and career of director, scholar, and theorist Herbert Blau, one of the most innovative voices in the American theater. From his earliest years on the streets of Brooklyn, with gang wars there, to the often embattled, now-legendary Actor's Workshop of San Francisco, the powerfully told story of Blau's first four decades is also a social history, moving from the Great Depression to the cold war, with fallout from \"the balance of terror\" on what he once described in an incendiary manifesto as The Impossible Theater . Blau has always forged his own path, from his activist resistance to the McCarthy witch hunts to his emergence as a revolutionary director whose work included the controversial years at The Workshop, which introduced American audiences to major playwrights of the European avant-garde, including Brecht, Beckett, Genet, and Pinter. There is also an account here of that notorious production of Waiting for Godot at the maximum-security prison at San Quentin, which became the insignia of the Theater of the Absurd. Blau went on from The Workshop to become codirector of the Repertory Theater of Lincoln Center, and then founding provost of California Institute of the Arts, where he developed and became artistic director of the experimental group KRAKEN. Currently Byron W. and Alice L. Lockwood Professor of the Humanities at the University of Washington, Blau has been visionary in the passage from theater to theory, and his many influential and award-winning books include The Dubious Spectacle: Extremities of Theater, 1976\u20132000; Sails of the Herring Fleet: Essays on Beckett; Nothing in Itself: Complexions of Fashion; To All Appearances: Ideology and Performance; The Audience; The Eye of Prey: Subversions of the Postmodern; and Take Up the Bodies: Theater at the Vanishing Point. This richly evocative book includes never-before-published photographs of the author, his family and friends, collaborators in the theater, and theater productions.

Avoiding the strife of the American Revolution entirely, Franklin focuses his incisive wit on the culture and society of colonial Philadelphia, weaving a mostly true mythology of humble origins and hard work that created the concepts of \"The American Dream\" and \"the self-made man.\" This edition includes letters written by Franklin as well as \"Poor Richard's Almanac,\" a popular pamphlet that was continuously reprinted from 1732-1758. Franklin's Autobiography, originally published in French in 1791, and translated into English and published in London in 1793, is considered the great autobiography of life in colonial America. American icon BENJAMIN FRANKLIN (1706-1790), born in Massachusetts to a British immigrant father and colonial mother, published the famous \"Poor Richard's Almanac,\" helped found the University of Pennsylvania, and was the first Postmaster General of the United States. Franklin's likeness adorns, among other things, the United States hundred-dollar bill.

Here he tells his story in his own way, freely expressing his joys and sorrows, his affections and hatreds, his rages and reverence\u2014ending, as always, tongue-in-cheek: \u201cNow, then, that is the tale. Some of it is true.\u201d More than the story of a literary career, this memoir is anchored in the writer\u2019s relation to his family\u2014what they meant to him as a husband, father, and artist. It also brims with many of Twain\u2019s best comic anecdotes about his rambunctious boyhood in Hannibal, his misadventures in the Nevada territory, his notorious Whittier birthday speech, his travels abroad, and more. Twain published twenty-five \u201cChapters from My Autobiography\u201d in the North American Review in 1906 and 1907. \u201cI intend that this autobiography . . . shall be read and admired a good many centuries because of its form and method\u2014form and method whereby the past and the present are constantly brought face to face, resulting in contrasts which newly fire up the interest all along, like contact of flint with steel.\u201d For this second edition, Michael Kiskis\u2019s introduction references a wealth of critical work done on Twain since 1990. He also adds a discussion of literary domesticity, locating the autobiography within the history of Twain\u2019s literary work and within Twain\u2019s own understanding and experience of domestic concerns.

Kennedy gave his most impassioned speech about the need for interracial tolerance \u2014Medgar Evers, the NAACP\u2019s first field secretary in Mississippi, was shot and killed by an assassin\u2019s bullet in his driveway. The still-smoking gun\u2014bearing the fingerprints of Byron De La Beckwith, a staunch white supremacist\u2014was recovered moments later in some nearby bushes. Still, Beckwith remained free for over thirty years, until Evers\u2019s widow finally forced the Mississippi courts to bring him to justice. The Autobiography of Medgar Evers tells the full story of one the greatest leaders of the civil rights movement, bringing his achievement to life for a new generation. Although Evers\u2019s memory has remained a force in the civil rights movement, the legal battles surrounding his death have too often overshadowed the example and inspiration of his life.Myrlie Evers-Williams and Manning Marable have assembled the previously untouched cache of Medgar\u2019s personal documents, writings, and speeches. These remarkable pieces range from Medgar\u2019s monthly reports to the NAACP to his correspondence with luminaries of the time such as Robert Carter, General Counsel for the NAACP in the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case. Most important of all are the recollections of Myrlie Evers, combined with letters from her personal collection. These documents and memories form the backbone of The Autobiography of Medgar Evers \u2014 a cohesive narrative detailing the rise and tragic death of a civil rights hero.

But ultimately, this great and talented man \u2014 an accomplished architect, naturalist, and linguist \u2014 wished to be remembered primarily as the author of the Declaration of Independence.

A first draft of the document is included in this edition, as are his comments on the Articles of Confederation, his experiences as a wartime governor of Virginia, minister to France and observations during the French Revolution. Also featured here are rich remembrances and insights as Jefferson recalls his roles as Washington's secretary of state and vice president under John Adams, and his life in retirement.

Q is his glittering and moving life story, told with the style, passion, and no-holds-barred honesty that are his trademarks. Quincy Jones grew up poor on the mean streets of Chicago\u2019s South Side, brushing against the law and feeling the pain of his mother\u2019s descent into madness. But when his father moved the family west to Seattle, he took up the trumpet and was literally saved by music. A prodigy, he played backup for Billie Holiday and toured the world with the Lionel Hampton Band before leaving his teens. Soon, though, he found his true calling, inaugurating a career whose highlights have included arranging albums for Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, Dinah Washington, Sarah Vaughan, and Count Basie; composing the scores of such films as The Pawnbroker , In Cold Blood , In the Heat of the Night , and The Color Purple , and the theme songs for the television shows Ironside , Sanford and Son , and The Cosby Show ; producing the bestselling album of all time, Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller , and the bestselling single \u201cWe Are the World\u201d; and producing and arranging his own highly praised albums, including the Grammy Award\u2014winning Back on the Block , a striking blend of jazz, African, urban, gospel, and hip-hop. His musical achievements, in a career that spans every style of American popular music, have yielded an incredible seventy-seven Grammy nominations, and are matched by his record as a pioneering music executive, film and television producer, tireless social activist, and business entrepreneur\u2013one of the most successful black business figures in America.

Avoiding the strife of the American Revolution entirely, Franklin focuses his incisive wit on the culture and society of colonial Philadelphia, weaving a mostly true mythology of humble origins and hard work that created the concepts of \"The American Dream\" and \"the self-made man.\" This edition includes letters written by Franklin as well as \"Poor Richard's Almanac,\" a popular pamphlet that was continuously reprinted from 1732-1758. Franklin's Autobiography, originally published in French in 1791, and translated into English and published in London in 1793, is considered the great autobiography of life in colonial America. American icon BENJAMIN FRANKLIN (1706-1790), born in Massachusetts to a British immigrant father and colonial mother, published the famous \"Poor Richard's Almanac,\" helped found the University of Pennsylvania, and was the first Postmaster General of the United States. Franklin's likeness adorns, among other things, the United States hundred-dollar bill.

Each featured psychologist narrates how historical circumstances, collaborations, internal struggles, and public conflict led him or her to choose and develop various lines of research. Over the past 50 years, psychology has expanded from behaviorism and psychoanalysis into cognitive and social theories of learning and brain-based models of behavior and memory. Contributors to this volume document their role in these and other movements, including personality theory and assessment and child development. Editors Gardner Lindzey and William M. Runyan have brought together a collection of essays that put a human face on the maturing science of psychology.

In the summer of 1878, Trollope advised his son Henry that he had written a memoir and that instructions for publication were written in a letter not to be opened until his death. It read in part: \"I leave it altogether to your discretion whether to publish or to suppress the work;\u2014and also to your discretion whether any part or what part shall be omitted. But I would not wish that anything should be added to the memoir. 1882. The memoirs were published as written, with the exception of a few passages (equivalent to about two printed pages) which Henry decided to suppress. The few footnotes are Anthony Trollope\u2019s own additions or corrections. The first two chapters of this memoir were written in the latter part of 1875, the third chapter early in January, 1876, and that he finished the record before the middle of April 1876. Orly Farm The plot revolves around the estate of Joseph Mason, a Yorkshire man who left a codicil to his will leaving Orley Farm (near London) to his young second wife and infant son. The will and the codicil were in her handwriting, however, and a bitter legal battle ensues. A second deed is later discovered which was signed by one of the witnesses on the same date as the will, although the witness can remember signing only one document. George Orwell said the book contained \"one of the most brilliant descriptions of a lawsuit in English fiction.\" Orley Farm is written in the realist mode and was Trollope's personal favourite of his many novels. About The Author English author Anthony Trollope wrote dozens of novels involving political, social, and gender issues, and on other current affairs. Sir Alec Guinness was a huge fan and reportedly never journeyed without a Trollope novel. Trollope is perhaps best known for his Barsetshire series, which is a collection of six novels (published in two volumes) and also available through Amazon: The Chronicles of Barsetshire is set in the fictitious English county of Barsetshire (located near where Dorset lies) and its cathedral town of Barchester, and they revolve around the clergy and the gentry, and the political, amatory, and social climbing.

Scott, and in nightclubs. On television he was well-loved for roles on \"The Young and the Restless,\" \"Days of our Lives,\" and of course, as Corporal Louis Lebeau on \"Hogan's Heroes.\" As a Holocaust survivor, Clary has lectured at high schools, colleges, synagogues, and civic groups throughout the U.S. and Canada.

Washington. He was born the illegitimate son of a white man and a Negro slave, and his struggle for education became the struggle of all his people for dignity in an alien society. W.E.B. DuBois's The Souls of Black Folk is one of the undeniably great American books of our time, both a literary classic and a major sociological document. No other book has had greater influence on Negro thinking, and nowhere is the Negro's unique heritage and his kinship with all men so passionately described. James Weldon Johnson's Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man was published anonymously in 1912. It is a remarkable human document on the life of the American Negro, a profound interpretation of his feeling towards the white man and towards the members of his own race. It does not seem likely that any other book will be written that touches with such understanding and objectivity on the phenomenon once called \"passing\" in white society. These three classic and crucial documents in the evolution of the Negroes' consciousness of self - key documents, as well, in the development of white society's awareness of the NEgro situation - have never been more timely.

In the summer of 1878 my father told me that he had written a memoir of his own life. He did not speak about it at length, but said that he had written me a letter, not to be opened until after his death, containing instructions for publication. This letter was dated 30th April, 1876. I will give here as much of it as concerns the public: \"I wish you to accept as a gift from me, given you now, the accompanying pages which contain a memoir of my life. My intention is that they shall be published after my death, and be edited by you. But I leave it altogether to your discretion whether to publish or to suppress the work;-and also to your discretion whether any part or what part shall be omitted. But I would not wish that anything should be added to the memoir. If you wish to say any word as from yourself, let it be done in the shape of a preface or introductory chapter.\" At the end there is a postscript: \"The publication, if made at all, should be effected as soon as possible after my death.\" My father died on the 6th of December, 1882...

It is the most important product of his creative brain.\" Nikola Tesla, uncelebrated oracle of the electronic age without whom our telephone, radio, automobile ignition, and television would have been unrealized, was born in Croatia in 1856. He studied physics and mathematics at Graz Poly Tech, then philosophy at the University of Prague. He went on to work as an electrical engineer in Budapest, Hungary, then France, and Germany. During this time he invented the alternating induction motor which allowed the possibility of the universal transmission and distribution of electricity. Nikola Tesla came to the United States in 1884 and worked for Thomas Edison, becoming Edison's rival because Edison only believed in the merchandising of inferior DC electric power. However, Tesla was employed as the dynamo designer for the Edison Machine Works while he obtained more than 100 patents and designed 700 inventions. He made a power transmission which was an economic necessity, yet his inventions did not make him a wealthy man. When he died in 1943 in his room at the Hotel New Yorker, his notable research on wireless communication by fax machines, radar, and radio-guided missiles evidenced the validity of his theories. He said, \"I am credited with being one of the hardest workers.\" ISBN13   PageCount 68 FirstAuthor Nikola Tesla SecondAuthor   ThirdAuthor   Rating 4.02 NumberofRatings 1661 NumberofReviews 144 Publisher   PublishDate   Format Kindle Edition Language English FileName 573-18919935-my-inventions.html   Entity 2: title Tesla's Autobiography Pages 122 Productdimensions 6.00(w) x 9.00(h) x 0.26(d) Salesrank 631,749 authors Nikola Tesla publication_info Publisher CreateSpace Publishing ISBN13 9781470101312 PublicationDate 02/18/2012  ",

Published to rave reviews, the Autobiography was hailed as the capstone of Twain\u2019s career. It captures his authentic and unsuppressed voice, speaking clearly from the grave and brimming with humor, ideas, and opinions. The eagerly-awaited Volume 2 delves deeper into Mark Twain\u2019s life, uncovering the many roles he played in his private and public worlds. Filled with his characteristic blend of humor and ire, the narrative ranges effortlessly across the contemporary scene. He shares his views on writing and speaking, his preoccupation with money, and his contempt for the politics and politicians of his day. Affectionate and scathing by turns, his intractable curiosity and candor are everywhere on view. Editors: Benjamin Griffin and Harriet E. Smith Associate Editors: Victor Fischer, Michael B.

Franklin ended his life's story in 1757, when he was only fifty-one. He planned to write more-a lot more, but never did. He lived another thirty-three full, eventful, and dramatic years, some of the most dramatic years in American history, years in which Franklin was America's advocate in London, represented Pennsylvania in the Continental Congress, and was America's wartime ambassador to France. During these years Franklin also helped write our nation's Constitution and planned an American Empire that would displace the British Empire. Franklin is one of the most fascinating of the Founding Fathers-a polymath like Jefferson, a practical statesman like Washington, and a cynic and wit beyond parallel. Now, at last, in The Compleated Autobiography by Benjamin Franklin, we finally get the rest of the story, in Franklin's own words. Faithfully compiled and edited from Franklin's papers by Dr. Mark Skousen-Franklin's descendant, acting as his devoted secretary-this is the closest we will ever get to Franklin sitting down in his study in Philadelphia, dipping quill into ink, and finishing his autobiography.

With characteristically calculated understatement, he attributed his enormous and varied successes to \"my having learnt a little to scribble.\" This collection of Franklin's works begins with letters sent from London (1757-1775) describing the events and diplomacy preceding the Revolutionary War. The volume also contains political satires, bagatelles, pamphlets, and letters written in Paris (1776-1785), where he represented the revolutionary United States at the court of Louis XVI, as well as his speeches given in the Constitutional Convention and other works written in Philadelphia (1785-1790), including his last published article, a searing satire against slavery. Also included are the delightfully shrewd prefaces to Poor Richard's Almanack (1733-1758) and their worldly, pungent maxims that have entered our American culture. Finally, the classic Autobiography, Franklin's last word on his greatest literary creation-his own invented personality-is presented here in a new edition, completely faithful to Franklin's manuscript. A companion volume includes the complete \"Silence Dogood\" series, \"Busy-Body\" essays, and a generous selection of his early writings, including letters to the press, satires, and pamphlets.

This volume brings together the key chapters of his most important and accessible books, including the Journal of Researches on the Beagle voyage (1845), The Origin of Species (1859), and The Descent of Man (1871), along with the full text of his delightful autobiography. They are accompanied by generous selections of responses from Darwin's nineteenth-century readers from across the world. More than anything, they give a keen sense of the controversial nature of Darwin's ideas, and his position within Victorian debates about man's place in nature. The wide-ranging Introduction by James A. Secord, Director of the Darwin Correspondence Project, explores the global impact and origins of Darwin's work and the reasons for its unparalleled significance today. To increase its usefulness for readers coming to Darwin for the first time, the selection also includes a map of the Beagle voyage, a detailed chronology of Darwin's life, and a biographical appendix identifying every individual mentioned in the text.

After a miserable childhood and misspent youth, Trollope turned his life around at the age of twenty-six. By 1860 the 'hobbledehoy' had become both a senior civil servant and a best-selling novelist. He worked for the Post Office for many years and stood unsuccessfully for Parliament. Best-known for the two series of novels grouped loosely around the clerical and political professions, the Barsetshire and Palliser series, in his Autobiography Trollope frankly describes his writing habits. His apparent preoccupation with contracts, deadlines, and earnings, and his account of the remorseless regularity with which he produced his daily quota of words, has divided opinion ever since. As the Introduction to this edition shows, Trollope selected and exaggerated to create his compelling narrative of initial failure and eventual success, and the inspiration that fuelled his creative imagination has too easily been overlooked. The only autobiography by a major Victorian novelist, Trollope's record offers a fascinating insight into his literary life and opinions. This edition also includes a selection of his critical writings to show how subtle and complex his approach to literature really was.

        "input": "Entity 1: ID 3570 Title Reading Autobiography: A Guide for Interpreting Life Narratives Description Autobiographical writing is redefining the meaning of narrative, as the recent explosion of memoirs by writers such as Frank McCourt, Mary Karr, Dave Eggers, and Kathryn Harrison suggests. But what's involved in bringing these narratives into the classroom-in creative writing, cultural studies, women's and ethnic studies, and social science and literature courses? How may instructors engage the philosophical, historical, social, and theoretical contexts of the emerging field of autobiography studies? Sidonie Smith and Julia Watson, two authorities in the field, distill their diverse forays into life writing in a concise yet far-reaching overview of key terms, issues, histories, and texts in autobiography studies. Reading Autobiography is a step-by-step introduction to the differences of autobiography from fiction and biography; the components of autobiographical acts; such core concepts as memory, experience, identity, agency, and the body; the textual and critical history of the field; and prospects for future research.

With characteristically calculated understatement, he attributed his enormous and varied successes to \"my having learnt a little to scribble.\" This collection of Franklin's works begins with letters sent from London (1757-1775) describing the events and diplomacy preceding the Revolutionary War. The volume also contains political satires, bagatelles, pamphlets, and letters written in Paris (1776-1785), where he represented the revolutionary United States at the court of Louis XVI, as well as his speeches given in the Constitutional Convention and other works written in Philadelphia (1785-1790), including his last published article, a searing satire against slavery. Also included are the delightfully shrewd prefaces to Poor Richard's Almanack (1733-1758) and their worldly, pungent maxims that have entered our American culture. Finally, the classic Autobiography, Franklin's last word on his greatest literary creation-his own invented personality-is presented here in a new edition, completely faithful to Franklin's manuscript. A companion volume includes the complete \"Silence Dogood\" series, \"Busy-Body\" essays, and a generous selection of his early writings, including letters to the press, satires, and pamphlets.

Although he was born in Winnipeg in 1912, Woodcock grew up in England. His memories of adolescence and young manhood take the reader through two World Wars and a Depression, before his return to Canada in 1949. Those whom he knew and who influenced him emerge in penetrating detail from Woodcock\u2019s narrative: his father, dying of Bright\u2019s Disease, yet with his spirit of adventure unquenched; his friend, George Orwell, \u201cbutter-fingeredly rolling cigarettes of the strongest black shag he could find and drinking tea as dark and almost as thick as treacle\u201d; and the teeming London political and literary figures of the \u201830s and \u20184Os he knew as editor of the spritely literary journal, NOW, and as a young anarchist and writer. George Woodcock, winner of the Governor General\u2019s Award and the Molson Prize, now lives in Vancouver, where he founded and edited for many years Canadian Literature. He has written countless articles and books, including critical studies of novelists Hugh MacLennan and Mordecai Richler and artist Ivan Eyre, as well as biographies of George Orwell, Thomas Merton, Oscar Wilde and Kropotkin, and the panoramic study of Canada entitled The Canadians. Here is what the critics have said of Letter to the Past: \u201cIt is not so much that chronicling the lives of William Godwin, Kropotkin, and Proudhon has constituted for Woodcock a profession like that of a portraitist; more that the underlying emotional attributes of anarchism a profound distrust of all authority mixed with a liberal dash of utopianism \u2014 have been the informing principles in his life.\u201d \u2014 Saturday Night \u201cThe graceful prose is so rich in detail that its effect is almost that of a life invented, not remembered.\u201d \u2014 Maclean\u2019s ISBN 155005192X ISBN13 9781550051926 PageCount 331 FirstAuthor George Woodcock SecondAuthor   ThirdAuthor   Rating 4.0 NumberofRatings 1 NumberofReviews 0 Publisher Fitzhenry & Whiteside PublishDate November 18th 2010 Format Paperback Language English FileName 2580-12995485-letter-to-the-past.html   Entity 2: title Beyond the Blue Mountain: An Autobiography Pages 304 Productdimensions 6.00(w) x 8.90(h) x 1.00(d) authors George Woodcock publication_info Publisher Fitzhenry &amp; Whiteside Ltd.

Shabkar Tsogdruk Rangdrol devoted himself to many years of meditation in solitary retreat after his inspired youth and early training in the province of Amdo under the guidance of several extraordinary Buddhist masters. With determination and courage, he mastered the highest and most esoteric practices of the Tibetan tradition of the Great Perfection. He then wandered far and wide over the Himalayan region expressing his realization. Shabkar's autobiography vividly reflects the values and visionary imagery of Tibetan Buddhism, as well as the social and cultural life of early nineteenth-century Tibet.

She grew up in a church as licentious as the world in which it was established: spiritually despondent and plagued by ignorance. Regardless of these tormenting conditions, she rose to the inimitability of Christian veneration. She had an unsteady and disorganized childhood, was tormented by sickness and abuse, and was imprisoned for years by the highest church authorities. She gave up her worldly goods at the demands of this church which led to her impoverishment. She survived her psychological and physical ruination by conquering pretentious royal conspiracies and reviling the malignancy of the papal inquisition. She committed her life to writing meditative books that illustrated profound truths lost to religious monarchs in a maze of their own confusion. She was finally condemned as a heretic, but her writings were so dynamic they shocked the whole country and even reached the indecorous palace of King Louis XIV. This is the story of a solitary woman whose pious diligence and dedication laid the bedrock of virtous obedience to the deeds of contemporaneous ministry.

Washington. He was born the illegitimate son of a white man and a Negro slave, and his struggle for education became the struggle of all his people for dignity in an alien society. W.E.B. DuBois's The Souls of Black Folk is one of the undeniably great American books of our time, both a literary classic and a major sociological document. No other book has had greater influence on Negro thinking, and nowhere is the Negro's unique heritage and his kinship with all men so passionately described. James Weldon Johnson's Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man was published anonymously in 1912. It is a remarkable human document on the life of the American Negro, a profound interpretation of his feeling towards the white man and towards the members of his own race. It does not seem likely that any other book will be written that touches with such understanding and objectivity on the phenomenon once called \"passing\" in white society. These three classic and crucial documents in the evolution of the Negroes' consciousness of self - key documents, as well, in the development of white society's awareness of the NEgro situation - have never been more timely.

He would not allow the book to be published until after his death, so that he could speak freely, as in a love letter. In the manner in which Twain is so well-known, his autobiography is really not an autobiography at all, but a series of entertaining stories and opinions, dinner table talks, such as he had always delivered in his own home and elsewhere, and with about the same latitude and elaboration. Twain's narrative is not in any sense a mere fairy tale, many of the chapters, especially the earlier ones, are vividly true in their presentation. The things he told of Mrs. Clemens and Susy are marvelously and beautifully true in spirit and aspect, and the story as a whole is amazingly faithful in the character picture it presents of the man himself.

We set out the next day, with an immense escort, and were followed by large crowds of people from Jellalob and the neighbouring cities. Buffaloes, richly caparisoned, were provided for us, and for most of the accompanying dignitaries; but we preferred our horses; and, in compliment to us, the dagash and several high officers from the Court also took their seats in the saddle. On either side of us were footmen, who supported over our heads, by long slender poles, awnings of pure linen. These were bedecked with streamers of variously-coloured muslin, and with wreaths of fresh flowers. A little in the rear came a hand-barrow, in which were conspicuously placed our muskets and pistols. These seemed to attract the largest share of public attention, and the barrow was frequently raised aloft to afford the people an opportunity of seeing the wonderful machines, which, in the hands of the Footas, were beginning to threaten their existence as a nation. We passed several of the columns that I have mentioned, surmounted with the usual cube of lava. A very lofty one having attracted my attention, Seywad dal Gouk, one of the lords of the Court, who rode by my side, volunteered an explanation. \"You must know,\" said he, \"that these columns are erected as mementoes of the Pholdefoos, or the ' Seekers of Truth.'\" \"True,\" I replied; \"the young prince Enphadde told me as much; but I do not understand, precisely, who these 'seekers of truth' are.\" \"They are,\" said the seywad, \"a class of pure, holy, and wise...

Avoiding the strife of the American Revolution entirely, Franklin focuses his incisive wit on the culture and society of colonial Philadelphia, weaving a mostly true mythology of humble origins and hard work that created the concepts of \"The American Dream\" and \"the self-made man.\" This edition includes letters written by Franklin as well as \"Poor Richard's Almanac,\" a popular pamphlet that was continuously reprinted from 1732-1758. Franklin's Autobiography, originally published in French in 1791, and translated into English and published in London in 1793, is considered the great autobiography of life in colonial America. American icon BENJAMIN FRANKLIN (1706-1790), born in Massachusetts to a British immigrant father and colonial mother, published the famous \"Poor Richard's Almanac,\" helped found the University of Pennsylvania, and was the first Postmaster General of the United States. Franklin's likeness adorns, among other things, the United States hundred-dollar bill.

He went on to say that \"there is a subtle devilish something or other about autobiographical composition that defeats all the writer's attempts to paint his portrait his way.\" With this in mind, Mark Twain began writing his autobiography, at the age of forty-two. He struggled with what to write about and in what order, frequently abandoning the project and returning to it every few years before finally hitting upon on the best way to write an autobiography: \"Start it at no particular time of your life; wander at your free will all over your life; talk only about the thing which interests you for the moment; drop it the moment its interest threatens to pale, and turn your talk upon the new and more interesting thing that has intruded itself into your mind meantime.\" This volume collects a number of Twain's autobiographical writings, collected from a variety of manuscripts, articles and dictations dated between 1870 and 1906. A true treasure for the fan of Mark Twain and American history and literature, the events described and the ruminations of America's greatest wit give a rare glimpse into another time and a gifted mind. Even though more than one hundred years have passed since Twain's thoughts and observations have been put to paper, they remain just as clever, humorous and insightful in modern times. This edition has been carefully produced with the reader in mind. The texts have been meticulously proofread and formatted with the Kindle screen in mind to create an optimum reading experience. As a bonus, photos of Mark Twain and his family have been included as well as a brief overview of Twain's life and legacy. There is no doubt that this edition will be an absolute pleasure to read for the Twain fan and casual reader alike.

        "input": "Entity 1: ID 3738 Title The Compleated Autobiography 1757-1790 Description Benjamin Franklin's celebrated Autobiography, published after his death, is one of the greatest autobiographies of all time ... but it was incomplete. Franklin ended his life's story in 1757, when he was only fifty-one. He planned to write more-a lot more, but never did. He lived another thirty-three full, eventful, and dramatic years, some of the most dramatic years in American history, years in which Franklin was America's advocate in London, represented Pennsylvania in the Continental Congress, and was America's wartime ambassador to France. During these years Franklin also helped write our nation's Constitution and planned an American Empire that would displace the British Empire. Franklin is one of the most fascinating of the Founding Fathers-a polymath like Jefferson, a practical statesman like Washington, and a cynic and wit beyond parallel. Now, at last, in The Compleated Autobiography by Benjamin Franklin, we finally get the rest of the story, in Franklin's own words. Faithfully compiled and edited from Franklin's papers by Dr. Mark Skousen-Franklin's descendant, acting as his devoted secretary-this is the closest we will ever get to Franklin sitting down in his study in Philadelphia, dipping quill into ink, and finishing his autobiography.

Mancham KBE, Founding President of the Republic of Seychelles, the 110 idyllic islands archipelago, who was overthrown in a Marxist coup in 1977 while he was in London to celebrate the Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. Sir James was also the lawyer for Philco-Ford, Pan Am and RCA when the US Air Force decided to build a strategic tracking station in Seychelles to gather military intelligence over the former Soviet Union during the Cold War. As Prime Minister of Seychelles, Sir James witnessed very closely the establishment by the USA of its most modern naval, air and military complex on the island of Diego Garcia. But Sir James autobiography Seychelles Global Citizen is more than a political treatise about the conflict for power and influence in the Indian Ocean and about Seychelles internal political intrigue and turmoil, it is also the story of a colorful human being who has been dubbed \"The Trudeau of the East\" and who has also been called \"The Ernest Hemmingway of the Indian Ocean.\" ISBN 1557788871 ISBN13 9781557788870 PageCount 350 FirstAuthor James R.

She married Herbert Henry Asquith, who would become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1908-1916). During World War I, Asquith's outspokenness led to a public outcry. For example, she visited a German prisoner of war camp and she accused her shell-shocked stepson Herbert of being drunk. The negative public and media response may well have contributed to the political downfall of her husband. After her husband's death, she was left in near penury and, though she made some money as a writer of numerous autobiographies, her financial position caused her constant concern. Her writing style was not always critically accepted-the most famous review of Asquith's work came from New York wit Dorothy Parker, who wrote, \"The affair between Margot Asquith and Margot Asquith will live as one of the prettiest love stories in all literature. \" ISBN 1409974995 ISBN13 9781409974994 PageCount 324 FirstAuthor Margot Asquith SecondAuthor   ThirdAuthor   Rating 3.15 NumberofRatings 13 NumberofReviews 2 Publisher Dodo Press PublishDate April 1st 2009 Format Paperback Language English FileName 464-14295314-an-autobiography.html   Entity 2: title Margot Asquith, An Autobiography - Two Volumes In One Pages 268 Productdimensions 6.00(w) x 9.00(h) x 0.56(d) prices Paperbackprice $15.95 Nookbookprice $2.99  authors Margot Asquith publication_info Publisher HardPress Publishing ISBN13 9781407625164 PublicationDate 01/29/2010  ",

Jefferson begins the work thusly, \"At the age of 77, I begin to make some memoranda and state some recollections of dates & facts concerning myself, for my own more ready reference & for the information of my family.\" While we gain some quick insight into his parents, his childhood, and the time before the revolution, much of the narrative focuses on his work on the Declaration of Independence and subsequently his political dealings in the newly formed republic. Jefferson was a man of the Enlightenment who, along with the other founding fathers, made a bold endeavor to create a new nation free from the British aristocracy.

Since his PBS television debut in the Blackadder series, the American profile of this multitalented writer, actor and comedian has grown steadily, especially in the wake of his title role in the film Wilde, which earned him a Golden Globe nomination, and his supporting role in A Civil Action. Fry has already given readers a taste of his tumultuous adolescence in his autobiographical first novel, The Liar , and now he reveals the equally tumultuous life that inspired it. Sent to boarding school at the age of seven, he survived beatings, misery, love affairs, carnal violation, expulsion, attempted suicide, criminal conviction and imprisonment to emerge, at the age of eighteen, ready to start over in a world in which he had always felt a stranger. One of very few Cambridge University graduates to have been imprisoned prior to his freshman year, Fry is a brilliantly idiosyncratic character who continues to attract controversy, empathy and real devotion. This extraordinary and affecting book has \"a tragic grandeur that lifts it to classic status,\" raved the Financial Times in one of the many ecstatic British reviews. Stephen Fry's autobiography, in turns funny, shocking, sad, bruisingly frank and always compulsively readable, could well become a classic gay coming-of-age memoir.

This volume brings together the key chapters of his most important and accessible books, including the Journal of Researches on the Beagle voyage (1845), The Origin of Species (1859), and The Descent of Man (1871), along with the full text of his delightful autobiography. They are accompanied by generous selections of responses from Darwin's nineteenth-century readers from across the world. More than anything, they give a keen sense of the controversial nature of Darwin's ideas, and his position within Victorian debates about man's place in nature. The wide-ranging Introduction by James A. Secord, Director of the Darwin Correspondence Project, explores the global impact and origins of Darwin's work and the reasons for its unparalleled significance today. To increase its usefulness for readers coming to Darwin for the first time, the selection also includes a map of the Beagle voyage, a detailed chronology of Darwin's life, and a biographical appendix identifying every individual mentioned in the text.

His most well-known work is his first autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave.

He spent a carefree childhood roaming the rivers and woods of Woodbury with his dog, Golly. Those rivers, lakes and woods were his Mississippi River. His love for sports led him into another world. What a great day it was - a boy and his dad going to a baseball game together. Next came his wrestling days during high school and college. All of these experiences gave him the self-discipline that he would need later in life. He thought that teaching and coaching would be his life's work, but quite unexpectedly, he ended up in the FBI. He was privileged to work some of the Bureau's highest profile cases such as the Patty Hearst kidnapping, Jim Jones and the People's Temple mass suicide, the Unabomber, the Chowchilla kidnapping of twenty-six children, and many more cases. He's had a great life with many wonderful memories, but the icing on the cake was his induction into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame as an Outstanding American.

Bill Bruford is a first-person account of his life in progressive rock, art rock, and modern jazz. Honest, entertaining, and eloquent, it recounts his life on the road and in the studio, rubbing shoulders and creating music with the famous, the less famous, and the infamous. A rocker with the temperament of a classical musician, who became a jazz musician, he defies all the clich\u00e9s and bad jokes about drummers. At polite dinner parties, Bruford is occasionally asked what he does. After replying that he\u2019s a musician, the inevitable retort is \u201cYes, but what do you really do?\u201d This funny, unusual, and unusually thoughtful memoir answers the question.

Robert Graves's stripped-to-the-bone prose seethes with contempt for his class, his country, his military superiors & the civilians who mindlessly cheered the carnage from the safety of home. His portrait of the stupidity & petty cruelties endemic in England's elite schools is almost as scathing as his depiction of trench warfare. Nothing could equal his bone-chilling litany of meaningless death, horrific encounters with gruesomely decaying corpses & even more appalling confrontations with the callousness & arrogance of the military command. Yet this scarifying book is consistently enthralling. He's a superb storyteller, & there's clearly something liberating about burning all your bridges at 34 (his age when Good-Bye to All That was published in 1929). He conveys that feeling of exhilaration to his readers in a pell-mell rush of words that remains supremely lucid. Better known as a poet, historical novelist & critic, Graves in this one work seems more like an English Hemingway, paring his prose to the minimum and eschewing all editorializing because it would bring him down to the level of the phrase-& war-mongers he despises.--Wendy Smith ISBN 0385093306 ISBN13 9780385093309 PageCount 347 FirstAuthor Robert Graves SecondAuthor   ThirdAuthor   Rating 4.05 NumberofRatings 6127 NumberofReviews 404 Publisher Anchor Books PublishDate February 1st 1958 Format Paperback Language English FileName 434-477900.Good_Bye_to_All_That.html   Entity 2: title Yo, Claudio / I, Claudius : A partir de la autobiografia de Claudio.

He went on to attain success as a songwriter on Broadway and as the compiler of the definitive Book of American Negro Spirituals . But he achieved one of his greatest triumphs in 1912, when, under a pseudonym, he published The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man \u2014a classic novel about a musician who rejects his black roots, a novel that is still in print today in multiple paperback editions. Johnson went on to be, from 1920 to 1930, the first African-American head of the NAACP, fighting tirelessly for the passage of a federal anti-lynching law. His life story is that of a truly remarkable man who triumphed over a system of institutionalized racism to become one of black America\u2019s leading educators, men of letters, and reformers.

Here he tells his story in his own way, freely expressing his joys and sorrows, his affections and hatreds, his rages and reverence\u2014ending, as always, tongue-in-cheek: \u201cNow, then, that is the tale. Some of it is true.\u201d More than the story of a literary career, this memoir is anchored in the writer\u2019s relation to his family\u2014what they meant to him as a husband, father, and artist. It also brims with many of Twain\u2019s best comic anecdotes about his rambunctious boyhood in Hannibal, his misadventures in the Nevada territory, his notorious Whittier birthday speech, his travels abroad, and more. Twain published twenty-five \u201cChapters from My Autobiography\u201d in the North American Review in 1906 and 1907. \u201cI intend that this autobiography . . . shall be read and admired a good many centuries because of its form and method\u2014form and method whereby the past and the present are constantly brought face to face, resulting in contrasts which newly fire up the interest all along, like contact of flint with steel.\u201d For this second edition, Michael Kiskis\u2019s introduction references a wealth of critical work done on Twain since 1990. He also adds a discussion of literary domesticity, locating the autobiography within the history of Twain\u2019s literary work and within Twain\u2019s own understanding and experience of domestic concerns.

It was his original intention to permit no publication of his memoirs until after his death; but, after leaving \"Pier No. 70,\" he concluded that a considerable portion might now suitably be given to the public.

Here he tells his story in his own way, freely expressing his joys and sorrows, his affections and hatreds, his rages and reverence\u2014ending, as always, tongue-in-cheek: \u201cNow, then, that is the tale. Some of it is true.\u201d More than the story of a literary career, this memoir is anchored in the writer\u2019s relation to his family\u2014what they meant to him as a husband, father, and artist. It also brims with many of Twain\u2019s best comic anecdotes about his rambunctious boyhood in Hannibal, his misadventures in the Nevada territory, his notorious Whittier birthday speech, his travels abroad, and more. Twain published twenty-five \u201cChapters from My Autobiography\u201d in the North American Review in 1906 and 1907. \u201cI intend that this autobiography . . . shall be read and admired a good many centuries because of its form and method\u2014form and method whereby the past and the present are constantly brought face to face, resulting in contrasts which newly fire up the interest all along, like contact of flint with steel.\u201d For this second edition, Michael Kiskis\u2019s introduction references a wealth of critical work done on Twain since 1990. He also adds a discussion of literary domesticity, locating the autobiography within the history of Twain\u2019s literary work and within Twain\u2019s own understanding and experience of domestic concerns.

It holds up remarkably well because Jim Tully was one of the founders of the spare, gritty unsentimental style that became known as \"hardboiled\" (of which Dashiell Hammett was the best known practitioner).\" \"Tully's father was a ditchdigger, his mother died when he was very young, and he spent several years in an orphanage. By the time he was 14 he was a road-kid hopping freight trains. He worked variously as a chain maker, a tree surgeon, and as a boxer - until he got knocked unconscious for 24 hours in a fight in San Francisco. Early on he also acquired a taste for reading and became a \"library bum\", hitting the stacks in the towns he tramped through. He loved Dumas and Dickens, but he above all sought to follow the example of Jack London and Maxim Gorky, two other road-kids who made it out of the tramp world through writing. And it worked for Tully too.\" He ended up in Hollywood, for a while as Charlie Chaplin's secretary, and then as practically the only honest - and therefore feared and respected - journalist in Hollywood; instead of rewriting the puff piece handouts of the powerful studios he wrote truthfully about the place.

This Library of America collection of Franklin's works begins with letters sent from London (1757\u20131775) describing the events and diplomacy preceding the Revolutionary War. The volume also contains political satires, bagatelles, pamphlets, and letters written in Paris (1776\u20131785), where he represented the revolutionary United States at the court of Louis XVI, as well as his speeches given in the Constitutional Convention and other works written in Philadelphia (1785\u20131790), including his last published article, a searing satire against slavery. Also included are the delightfully shrewd prefaces to Poor Richard's Almanack (1733\u20131758) and their worldly, pungent maxims that have entered our American culture. Finally, the classic Autobiography, Franklin's last word on his greatest literary creation\u2014his own invented personality\u2014is presented here in a new edition, completely faithful to Franklin's manuscript. A companion volume includes the complete \"Silence Dogood\" series, \"Busy-Body\" essays, and a generous selection of his early writings, including letters to the press, satires, and pamphlets. J. A. Leo Lemay, editor of this volume, is professor of colonial literature at the University of Delaware. The author of numerous works on Franklin, including The Canon of Benjamin Franklin 1722\u20131776: New Attributions and Reconsiderations, he has edited The Oldest Revolutionary and (with P. M.

He would not allow the book to be published until after his death, so that he could speak freely, as in a love letter. In the manner in which Twain is so well-known, his autobiography is really not an autobiography at all, but a series of entertaining stories and opinions, dinner table talks, such as he had always delivered in his own home and elsewhere, and with about the same latitude and elaboration. Twain's narrative is not in any sense a mere fairy tale, many of the chapters, especially the earlier ones, are vividly true in their presentation. The things he told of Mrs. Clemens and Susy are marvelously and beautifully true in spirit and aspect, and the story as a whole is amazingly faithful in the character picture it presents of the man himself.

Avoiding the strife of the American Revolution entirely, Franklin focuses his incisive wit on the culture and society of colonial Philadelphia, weaving a mostly true mythology of humble origins and hard work that created the concepts of \"The American Dream\" and \"the self-made man.\" This edition includes letters written by Franklin as well as \"Poor Richard's Almanac,\" a popular pamphlet that was continuously reprinted from 1732-1758. Franklin's Autobiography, originally published in French in 1791, and translated into English and published in London in 1793, is considered the great autobiography of life in colonial America. American icon BENJAMIN FRANKLIN (1706-1790), born in Massachusetts to a British immigrant father and colonial mother, published the famous \"Poor Richard's Almanac,\" helped found the University of Pennsylvania, and was the first Postmaster General of the United States. Franklin's likeness adorns, among other things, the United States hundred-dollar bill.

Hero or villain, one thing about Maradona is certain: He was the greatest soccer player of his generation\u2014and perhaps of all\u2013time. Never before has the legendary Maradona given us his extraordinary story in his own words\u2014until now. From his poverty\u2013stricken origins to his greatest glories on the field, Maradona recounts, with astonishing frankness and brilliant insight, the pivotal moments of his life\u2014the pressures of being a child prodigy, the infamous semi\u2013final game against England in the 1986 World Cup, an incredible turn\u2013around and the dream\u2013turned\u2013sour at Napoli, and the shame and disgrace of his positive drug test at USA 1994. In this amazingly honest autobiography, we see inside the mind of one of the most talented, controversial, and complex sportsmen of our times\u2014a man torn between the demands of corporate club bosses, the fans, the media, and his own tempestuous personal life. With a new epilogue exclusive to this paperback edition that brings Maradona\u2019s remarkable story up\u2013to\u2013date and more than eighty wonderful photographs, Maradona is a confessional, a revelation, an apology, and a celebration.

But in his mind, he was first and foremost a businessman. Franklin's captivating adventures include his almost single-handed responsibility for establishing the first media empire, the first public library, the first fire brigade, the University of Pennsylvania, the first book club and the first franchise--all of which are detailed within these pages with Franklin's characteristic mix of humility and pride. Franklin chronicles his own story, from his early days growing up in colonial Boston to his retirement from printing and growing involvement in national politics. It was during these years that he honed his management and leadership skills, acquired a fervent distaste for tyranny of all types, embraced a strong set of morals, and developed an uncompromising work ethic. From the moment he fled his tyrannical master and set himself up as a printer in Philadelphia, all who came into contact with Franklin recognized his destiny.

The Autobiography of Japan's Bravest Fighter Ace Description THE GRIPPING SAGA OF THE RISE AND FALL OF THE JAPANESE NAVAL AIR FORCE IN WORLD WAR II THROUGH THE CAREER OF ONE OF ITS BEST FIGHTER ACES Written by Martin Caidin from Saburo Sakai's own memoirs and journalist Fred Saito's extensive interviews with the World War II fighter pilot, Samurai! vividly documents the chivalry and valor of the combat aviator who time after time fought American fighter pilots and, with 64 kills, would survive the war as Japan's greatest living ace. Here are the harrowing experiences of one of Japan's greatest aces: from fighter pilot school -- where the harsh training expelled over half of his class -- to the thrilling early Japanese victories; from his incredible six hundred mile fight for life from Guadalcanal to his base in Rabaul, to the poignant story of the now-handicapped veteran's return to the air during the final desperate months of World War II.

Although he had inherited an important historic medicine bundle, he was not a hereditary civil chief of the Sauk, but was an appointed war chief. He was generally known in English as Black Hawk. During the War of 1812, he fought on the side of the British. Later he led a band of Sauk and Fox warriors against settlers in Illinois and present-day Wisconsin in the 1832 Black Hawk War. After the war he was captured and taken to the eastern U. S. where he and other British Band leaders toured several cities. Near the end of his captivity in 1833, he told his life story to a government interpreter, which was edited by a local reporter and became the first Native American autobiography published in the United States, entitled Autobiography of Maka- tai-me-she-kia-kiak; or, Black Hawk.

With characteristically calculated understatement, he attributed his enormous and varied successes to \"my having learnt a little to scribble.\" This collection of Franklin's works begins with letters sent from London (1757-1775) describing the events and diplomacy preceding the Revolutionary War. The volume also contains political satires, bagatelles, pamphlets, and letters written in Paris (1776-1785), where he represented the revolutionary United States at the court of Louis XVI, as well as his speeches given in the Constitutional Convention and other works written in Philadelphia (1785-1790), including his last published article, a searing satire against slavery. Also included are the delightfully shrewd prefaces to Poor Richard's Almanack (1733-1758) and their worldly, pungent maxims that have entered our American culture. Finally, the classic Autobiography, Franklin's last word on his greatest literary creation-his own invented personality-is presented here in a new edition, completely faithful to Franklin's manuscript. A companion volume includes the complete \"Silence Dogood\" series, \"Busy-Body\" essays, and a generous selection of his early writings, including letters to the press, satires, and pamphlets.

He went on to say that \"there is a subtle devilish something or other about autobiographical composition that defeats all the writer's attempts to paint his portrait his way.\" With this in mind, Mark Twain began writing his autobiography, at the age of forty-two. He struggled with what to write about and in what order, frequently abandoning the project and returning to it every few years before finally hitting upon on the best way to write an autobiography: \"Start it at no particular time of your life; wander at your free will all over your life; talk only about the thing which interests you for the moment; drop it the moment its interest threatens to pale, and turn your talk upon the new and more interesting thing that has intruded itself into your mind meantime.\" This volume collects a number of Twain's autobiographical writings, collected from a variety of manuscripts, articles and dictations dated between 1870 and 1906. A true treasure for the fan of Mark Twain and American history and literature, the events described and the ruminations of America's greatest wit give a rare glimpse into another time and a gifted mind. Even though more than one hundred years have passed since Twain's thoughts and observations have been put to paper, they remain just as clever, humorous and insightful in modern times. This edition has been carefully produced with the reader in mind. The texts have been meticulously proofread and formatted with the Kindle screen in mind to create an optimum reading experience. As a bonus, photos of Mark Twain and his family have been included as well as a brief overview of Twain's life and legacy. There is no doubt that this edition will be an absolute pleasure to read for the Twain fan and casual reader alike.

From his earliest years on the streets of Brooklyn, with gang wars there, to the often embattled, now-legendary Actor's Workshop of San Francisco, the powerfully told story of Blau's first four decades is also a social history, moving from the Great Depression to the cold war, with fallout from \"the balance of terror\" on what he once described in an incendiary manifesto as The Impossible Theater. Blau has always forged his own path, from his activist resistance to the McCarthy witch hunts to his emergence as a revolutionary director whose work included the controversial years at The Workshop, which introduced American audiences to major playwrights of the European avant-garde, including Brecht, Beckett, Genet, and Pinter. There is also an account here of that notorious production of Waiting for Godot at the maximum-security prison at San Quentin, which became the insignia of the Theater of the Absurd. Blau went on from The Workshop to become codirector of the Repertory Theater of Lincoln Center, and then founding provost of California Institute of the Arts, where he developed and became artistic director of the experimental group KRAKEN. Currently Byron W. and Alice L. Lockwood Professor of the Humanities at the University of Washington, Blau has been visionary in the passage from theater to theory, and his many influential and award-winning books include The Dubious Spectacle: Extremities of Theater, 1976\u20132000; Sails of the Herring Fleet: Essays on Beckett; Nothing in Itself: Complexions of Fashion; To All Appearances: Ideology and Performance; The Audience; The Eye of Prey: Subversions of the Postmodern; and Take Up the Bodies: Theater at the Vanishing Point. This richly evocative book includes never-before-published photographs of the author, his family and friends, collaborators in the theater, and theater productions.
